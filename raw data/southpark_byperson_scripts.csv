Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed... In the dark... And slowly my bedroom door began to open... And then the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway! Then I was lying on a table, and these scary aliens wanted to operate on me!  And they had big heads... And big black eyes- What? (Nervous) No, it was just a dream. My mom said so! Ah shut up, you guys, you're just trying to make me scared, and it's not working. Kick ass! HUH?! No! Th-That was just a dream! And I'm NOT fat, I'm big-boned. (PETRIFIED) AH! AGH! (Defensive) No! I mean... Uh... Why would they do that? NO! SHUT UP, DILDO! (Extremely angry) God Dammit, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream! Shut up! Shut up, you guys, it's not working. Somebody's baking brownies. Uhh.. Huh, huh... That's a little joke. Ha, ha! Mr. Hat yelled at you! AAAGHH!! Ow, my ass! OW! OWWW MY ASS!! No, that was just a dream! No, Mr. Garrison. I'm fine. OOOOWWWW!!! Ooh, I sure am hungry. Shut up, dude. You're being totally immature. (Singing) Stan wan-ts to ki-ss Wen-dy Testaburger I'm not fat - And you obviously like her, because you throw up every time she talks to you! Or slip her the tongue. I get it. You ARE making it up! What? Oh, I see, now YOU'RE going to join in on the little joke, huh? You guys sure are going a long way to try to scare me. I WANT MY SALISBURY STEAK!!! OHHHH - YOU GUYS, MY ASS!! SERIOUSLY. I would if I could you son of a bitch! Would you stop going on about your little brother?! I KNOW it was just a dream! I KNOW I didn't have an anal probe! And I KNOW that I'm not under alien control!!! (Singing) I love to sing-a! About the moon-a and the Juna and the spring-a! I love to sing-a! About a sky of blue or a tea for two. Oh, son of a bitch. You guys shut up, I'm not under alien control. Ow! That hurts, you butt licker! No! He's not dead. Shut up, you guys. GOD DAMMIT I DIDN'T HAVE AN ANAL PROBE!!! Screw you guys, I'm going home! Hi Mom. Well, I'm pissed off. I don't want powder doughnut pancake surprise! All the kids at school call me fat! That's what I said. NO! NO leave me alone mom! What? Well that does sound pretty good. Uh, Mom? If anybody calls or comes over - I'm not here, okay? Yea I want Cheesy Poofs! Hey, that kinda looks like... Tom Selleck. No Kitty... This is MY pot-pie. No kitty! Bad Kitty!!

Oh man, I had this crazy nightmare last night... Well, I was standing out in a field and I had this HUGE satellite dish stickin' outta my butt. And then there was hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pink eye. Oh, I hate those things. Well, you know... You'll just be sitting there minding your own business, and they'll come marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass - And you'll be all like 'Hey get out of my ASS YOU STUPID RAINBOWS!!! I'm talking about rainbows! I hate those friggin' things. Ohhhhhh.... RAINBOWS. Oh yeah, I like those, those are cool. Huh? Oh, nothing, forget it. Nothing.... (Just as shocked) What?! Kick ass. Yeah I do, Pop-Tarts are frosted. (Not remembering) Oh... You know... This and that. Well you see? You shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid. (Guffawing smugly) Oh, right... If they're so damn smart how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?! You guys, guess what... After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous! Hey!!! That kid is me! (Pissed off) ME!! ERIC CARTMAN!! Yes ma'am! (Singing) I'm gonna be on television! I'm gonna be on television! (Singing) I'm gonna be on television! I'm gonna be on television! Hey, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish. Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise. If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?! Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares? It's all a bunch of tree-hugging hippie crap! Uh, I can't, I have to go home and get in shape! Yeah! I only weigh ninety pounds! YES! BEEFCAKE. BEEFCAKE!!!! Mom, can you get me some WEIGHT GAIN 4000? But mom I need it for tomorrow. MOM....... Hey dudes. Listen... I have a nice body and I wanna show it off. You got that? I'm up to ninety-four, thank you very much. Laugh all you want. I'm the one who's gonna be on T.V. looking all buff. Weight Gain 4000. It's helping me bulk up. Hey! I don't have to take that kinda crap from you scrawny weaklings! Sweet, check me out! I'm such a beefcake I can't even get through the door! Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely. I'm not fat, I'm getting in shape! No they don't, you jealous weakling! Hey! Oh, look, another hippie. Peace, Wendy. (Singing) Oh, two little hippies sittin' in a tree......! This is sweet. The camera crews are setting up, and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake BEEFCAKE! Oh no you don't! You're not gonna ruin MY moment of fame! You gotta get over this whole jealousy thing alright. Seriously, just face it, I wrote a better paper than you. Cartman, God Dammit!!! Here it is! My big moment of fame! Hey, wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?! But I won the environmental essay contest!! When is this gonna be on the air? Follow your dreams. You can reach your goals. I'm living proof. Beefcake BEEFCAKE!!! Dude, that's SICK, mom! (To Uncle Jimbo) Drive! Drive! Drive the car damnit drive. Shut up! I'm not scared of nothing! You piece of crap! I'll kill you! Hey, I didn't get a gun! Sweet. This is like the gun I used in Nam. Hey! I'll blow your friggin' head off! My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa. Democrats piss me off! Kick ass! Oh, dude... I'm starting to have flashbacks! Danforth! Pull up flank, look out for Charlies up in the trees! I got your back, soldier! Yeah, hippie! Go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything! I can shoot you too. I'll fill you full of lead. My wienies won't cook! Hey you guys! This works pretty good right now! (Obviously scared) Huh-huh... That's not scary... SHUT UP! I DIDN'T PEE MY PANTS!!!! Oh, you would taste my pee. Hey you guys... I know a scary story. Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of... Scuzzlebutt? Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain and kills anybody who dares climb to the top. Because it loves the taste of blood! And likes to add pieces to its deformed body! Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand he has... No! (Pause) ...A piece of celery. Yes, and he walks with a limp, because one of his legs is missing... And where his leg should be, there's nothing but... PATRICK DUFFY! What do you mean? Have you ever seen 'Step by Step'?! So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights, you can hear him weaving his baskets... Ka shink... Ka-shink... Ka-shink. (Suddenly scared) HEY! It might be!! Screw you guys! They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh, Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt. I'll scare the hell out of 'em tomorrow. I am Scuzzlebutt! Lord of the Mountains! Behold my Patrick Duffy leg. Huh-huh... Those guys are totally scared. Holy crap!!! What the hell is wrong with you people?! Hey wait. Arhhhhhhh!!! (Very faint) You guys, it's just me. I've got to get out of this stupid costume. You guys, you guys I was just kidding. Hey!! Seriously you guys... HEY!!!! God Dammit, don't shoot me! I was just trying to scare you guys. You can put that gun down now. HELP!!!! What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?! Ugh, you're making me sick, dude. No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park! Oh yeah? Let's see... HEY SYLVESTER! I'll put a dollar on Sylvester! Huh... He's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass. Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay! That dog is a gay homosexual. (Singing) Stan's dog's a homo! Stan's dog's a homo! What's homecoming? There he goes again! Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual. And so you see, Simon and Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television. Aw, Dammit! AY! Wait a minute! Why the hell does he get an A-?! That's not fair! (To himself) Stupid puppet. You see me block that defense today? I was kicking ass. Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog. Man, that is the gayest dog I have ever seen. He still looks pretty gay to me. There he goes! No way, dude! My mom says God hates gay people... That's why He smote the sodomies in France. Oh Marty's Movie reviews are on?! Kick ass!! Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants. OW!! Did you check the shopping mall? OW! We'll just see about that! No I didn't! That was just my shoes. That's right you get back there now. Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously I'm worried about you man. (laughing) Yup, your sister kicked your ass. I would NEVER let a woman kick my ass! If she tried anything, I'd be like 'HEY! You get your bitch ass back in the kitchen and make me some pie!!' Be a man, Stan. Just say 'HEY WOMAN! YOU, YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH AND MAKE BABIES!' Whoa, dude, where'd you get a pet elephant? That's why MY mom got ME a pot bellied pig. 'Cause it's poop is small. If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say 'HEY! YOU GO DO MY LAUNDRY And... Yes, ma'am. Hey!! You leave Fluffy out of this! You're not using any of Fluffy's blood! Else I'll kick you in the nuts. Kyle... Kyle! No! NOBODY'S SPLICING NOTHING FROM FLUFFY!! Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass I'd be all like, 'HEY, LISTEN MISSY!!! WHY DON'T YOU GO KNIT ME A SWEATER BEFORE I SLAP YOU IN THE FACE!!!!' Well, looks like nobody's home. Guess we should come back some other time. It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you. Baby? Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl! AY!! I'm taking my pig and screw you guys, I'm going home. This whole idea is stupid anyway! AY!! Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?! I'll kick you in the nuts!! It's okay fluffy... Nobody's going to hurt you... Hey... These bunny ears are tied on with little strings! You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass! Come on Fluffy!!! Oh, I sure am hungry. Go away, Pip, nobody likes you. God Damnit would you shut the hell up?! Nobody gives a rat's ass. God, French people piss me off. Hey, I'll kick your ass. What?! (insulted) I don't think my pig would wanna make love to that stupid elephant!! Why, your sister gonna kick your ass again? Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass I'd be like 'HEY, WHY DON'T YOU STOP DRESSING ME UP LIKE A MAILMAN AND MAKING ME DANCE FOR YOU WHILE YOU GO AND SMOKE CRACK IN YOUR BEDROOM AND HAVE SEX WITH SOME GUY I DON'T EVEN KNOW ON MY DADS BED!"" I'm just saying you're just a little wuss. That's all. No you don't gotta get Cartman's pig. You leave Fluffy out of this! Kyle NO!! Seriously!! NO ELEPHANT IS GOING TO MAKE LOVE TO MY FLUFFY. Kyle I would kick you in the nuts. (crying) Fluffy!!! Aren't they ever gonna wake up? Well good job Einstein! Why don't we just build a rocket in the mean time?! I ain't helping crap! I wanna eat some pie! Oh yeah? Watch me! Hey, it kinda looks like Mr. Garrison. Sweet! That's a bunch of crap. Kyle's mom is a dirty jew. That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance and Phillip last night! Why does this happen every month? It seems like right about the same time every month Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something -- and I always end up getting screwed by it! Oh gee, I wonder whose mother THAT could have been! WHAT?! Hey! Maybe we could get him to kill Kyle's mom! Man, I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance and Phillip today! I think I'm already having withdrawal! Just kill him, dude, maybe he'll give you some money. Yeah, like assisted suicide, what about that? I would never kill somebody -- not unless they pissed me off. WHAT?! HEY! YOU PIECE OF CRAP! I'LL KILL YOU!! Don't talk about my mom like that!! I can't believe that son of a bitch! (Suddenly fine) Ooh, snacky cakes? Good deal... Hey you guys! 'Terrance and Phillip' is on! Yeah, just 'cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer. Oh, Bitch... your mom is a Bitcha Bitcha Bitch... (Laughing) Oh oh... I bet I know what's coming! Hey, you're gonna miss it, Kenny! Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna miss the fart!! I don't know... Why don't we just shoot him? Why is Death coming after us? What are we gonna do?! Oh, oh. Don't look there Phillip, you're going to get farted on!! (To Kyle) You son of a bitch! Your mom sucks! NOOOOO!!!! GOD NOOOOOO!!!!! My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool... Yeah!

My mom made it. Isn't it Cool? What are you supposed to be, Stan? Howdy Doody? Oh. Wow, you look pretty cool. Oh look out! Holly Hobby is all pissed off!! Kenny's family is so poor, that yesterday they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage. (Agitated) I said your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage!! Kenny!!! I'm talking to you, Kenny! Achtung!! Poor piece of crap. You see? All of a sudden my costume is pretty bad ass, huh? You're just jealous. Why don't you go back to Endor, you stupid Wookie! (Mimicing him) Mama ma mi mo momo! What? What did you say?! Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding? (in a different voice) No, Eric, go ahead and take my pudding if you like. (normal voice) Why thank you, Kenny, how nice of you! (mouth full) Eating Kenny's pudding. Hey, he SAID I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself! (in a different voice) That's right Principal Victoria, it's okay with me 'cause Eric is cool. My mom made it. (loudly) SEIG HIEL!! SEIG HIEL!! Squueeee!! I don't want to see an educational video. Juden est forbideen! Est una scrava uts cafiga hoda!! Can I see that again? That was cool! I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy. (whiny) I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost! Boo! I'm a ghost! Oh c'mon Stan. Maybe that's just because you LOOK like a total chode. Hey Chef. Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts huh! What is that? Who? Where the hell is Kyle? We don't have all night to wait for him! Are you crazy? I'm the Candy Master! Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstockings! God Dammit! My mom is NOT on the cover of Crack whore magazine!!! Check. Yeah, granola pisses me off! Whew! You stink, Kenny! Too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire! I said YOUR DAD WOULD BE A MILLIONAIRE!! KENNY!!! Kenny your family is poor!! Kenny your family's poor!!! (To Stan) I don't like Kenny anymore. He just doesn't communicate. Hi Wendy. YOU WHAT?! ARE YOU INSANE?! How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks? Oh nice going, Kenny! She was about to give us the candy! You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole! (pissed) Dammit! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people! Hey... They're all dressed up like ghosts too! ONE Tootie bar?! You cheap bastards! Can we have candy now, please? I'm TRYING to trick or treat God Dammit!! (having an epiphany) ...then there won't be anyone to give US CANDY!!!!!!!!! AAHHHH! It was Kyle. Remember candy. Focus on the candy. It's the British kid!! He's a little limy zombie now!! Hey! There's a payphone!! Nobody screws up my Trick or Treats and gets away with it. Yeah cool! Finish her, dude! She's a Zombie now! Come on, Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest! Kill her, Stan!! Okay let's go trick or treating now come on! Let us remember the good times... Kenny would have wanted it that way. (Suddenly fine) Well, let's get home and start eating candy. Knock it off, you guys!! She said she was young and she needed the money!! (Off-screen) Screw you guys!! They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend. Thaaaat's right! (Singing) 'Cause it's my birthday! My Bu-Bu Birthdayyy! That's right! That's right! (Catching himself) HEY! Oh really? Gosh, where could I have put Pip's invitation? Let's see... Pip's invitation... Pip's invitation... OH, I REMEMBER! I shoved it up my ass! Yes that's right, I wrote it out, put it in a envelope, sealed it, and then PLOOP! Shoved it right my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party. Sorry, Pip ol' chap. Here's yours Wendy, and here's yours Clyde... No, my birthday isn't until Saturday. Hey new kid, do you want an invitation to my birthday party? PSYCHE!! I wasn't gonna GIVE you an invitation!! HA, HA!! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder? HEY! I had a poofie pie in that desk. (Singing) You got in trou-ble! You got in trou- ble! Right. That's what you're supposed to get me for my birthday. Look, it's very simple, guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega-Man and Yellow Mega-Man to make the Ultra- Mega-Mega-Man. You have to have all three or doesn't work, see? Oh! So maybe you don't want to have any of my mom's cake pie and ice cream then! Now, as you can see, Kenny, YOU are to get me Yellow Mega-Man. That's because yellow Mega-Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is... Yeah, you can't sit with us, weirdo! Anyway, Kenny, yellow Mega-Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two. HEY!! Turn him back you butthole!! He has to buy me the yellow Mega- Man!! Now, as you can see, the Red Mega- Man uses the -- (Pointing) Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, YOU were supposed to get me the Mega Power Chopper illustrated -- (Pointing) HERE. But I am changing your present to the Yellow Mega-Man, since Kenny has been turned into a -- (Pointing) duck billed platypus. That means that the Mega-Man Beach House, illustrated here... Will be a gift given by two people at once... Hey, wait a minute! Saturday is my birthday party! They can't have the fight on Saturday! Cartman's birthday! You guys! My mom's getting a ferris wheel! WHO THE HELL DECIDED THIS FIGHT HAD TO BE ON SATURDAY HUH?!! THIS WHOLE THING IS A PLOT AGAINST ME, ISN'T IT!! (Aside) Don't mind him, Jesus. He's Jewish. Oh, here comes unholy butthole now. Hey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch! Oh, oh! Oh, excuse me, new kid! I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice! You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents? Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left... Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left... Welcome Chef... HEY! What the hell do you think you're doing here?! Yeah, come on in and join the party! Oh, I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday... Oh look! A blue Mega- Man! Thank you, Stan, you may eat pie and cake and ice cream, now. And what did Wendy get me? (Before he even opens it) Oh, it's The Yellow Mega-Man! Help yourself to pie, cake and ice cream, Wendy. Oh! Look what Kyle got me! it's a Red Mega -- (Opening the gift) Ants in the Pants?! ANTS IN THE PANTS?! ANTS IN THE PANTS?! YOU SON OF A BITCH!!!! YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN!!!

GET THE HELL OUT I SAID!! PARTY'S OVER!!! GET OUT GODAMNIT!! Take you stupid ants in the pants with you!!! (Pissed) Get out of the way, mom! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving special is on!! (Calling after her) And yeah we want cheesy poofs!! Did you guys see that?! That was sweet! Yeah. ...Hey! That's stupid. Who the hell would want to do that? KICK ASS!! When do we get the sports watch? You vas diferens! I get to wear it first you guys!! Yeah, but I get to wear it first. I said!! When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out? (Raising his hand) Mr. Garrison, why do poor people always smell like sour milk? I'm not bringing in food for poor people. Screw them! Hey you guys, do you hear something? I think I hear the flower children calling. Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that I pay for?! Well then perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population! Mom... Did our Digital Sports Watch come yet? What the hell?! (Laughing) Yeah. STARVIN' Marvin! Hey Mom! We found a Etheropian; can we keep him? Sweet. No, No! He's my son, I adopted him. Yeah, and never with Kenny 'cause his family is too poor. OW! Yeah, here you can eat all you want for only $6.99 That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights. Except for Kenny's family, 'cause to them $6.99 is two year's income. Why is YOUR family poor, Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too? You see, Starvin Marvin, these are what we call APPETIZERS. This is what you eat before you eat... to make you more hungry. Oop! Food's here! That's it for the appetizers! No Starvin' Marvin that's my pot pie! Oh yeah you're right. (to Marvin) Are you going to eat all of your peach cobbler? No you don't want all that. Why don't you share it with me... Let me just have some of that. No! Starvin' Marvin, that's KENNY's creamed corn! No Starvin' Marvin... That's a BAD starvin' Marvin! Oh well, back to the poor country with you. Oh yeah, right. (O.S. and distant) HEY!!!! seriously. You're pissing me off... (In the distance) HEY! SOMEBODY GET ME OUT OF HERE! THIS SUCKS!! (Still in distance) I'M SERIOUSLY GETTING PISSED OFF OVER HERE!!!!

Oh sweet, the Red Cross. I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please. What!!!! But I'm not a starvin' ethernopian. I have to get back home too. WEAKKKKK!!!!!! Can't... go on... need appetizer... (Shouting to the sky) I'M SORRY GOD, I'M SORRY I MOCKED POOR PEOPLE!! I'M SORRY I WASN'T MORE SENSITIVE!! PLEASE!!! PLEASE GOD!!!! (Quietly) My God has forsaken me... Whoa, I wonder what's in here? SNACKY CAKES!!! SALLY STRUTHERS?! Give me that cake!! NO SALLY STRUHTHERS, GIMME THE CAKE!! Oh yeah?! YOU GUYS!! SALLY STRUTHERS IS HOLDING FOOD FROM US!!! That's right you will, God dammit! Move it, Povs! I'm an AMERICAN!! Oooh! Oh good, Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas! I'm not fat! I'm festively plump! What the hell is Christmas poo? Hey! What the hell are you doing?! Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow! Yeah, we'll see you later, Kyle. Guess there's no reason for you to come since you don't get Christmas presents. Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that. Oh Kyle, c'mon seriously, you are really reaching right now. (Super snooty) You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, KYLE. Oh boy, super bitch is at it again. Don't mind him, he's a very disturbed little boy. How do you know? Yeah, well I sneaked around my mom's closet too and saw what I'm getting: The 'UltraVibe Pleasure 2000'. I don't know, but it sounds pretty sweet. Lemme see! Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?! Thanks to Kyle's mother. How about we sing 'Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch in D minor'. Oh! Wellllllll.... (Singing) Kyle's mom's a bitch! She a big fat bitch! She's the biggest bitch In the whole wide world! She's a stupid bitch if there ever was a bitch She's a bitch to all the boys and girls. Monday she's a bitch! On Tuesday she's a bitch! And Wednesday through Saturday She's a bitch! And then on Sunday just to be different She's a super King Kamayamaya BITCH! Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world She's a mean ol' bitch and she has stupid hair, she's a bi... bi... bi... bi bitch... She's a stupid bitch.

Wow, she's PRETTY!! Yes ma'am! No, he always pukes when he's in love. She wasn't looking at you, buttLord! She was looking at ME. Until you puked on her. I'm going to buy a vacuum cleaner. Chicks love vacuum cleaners. ME! ME! ME! What's a multiplication table? We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth was going out with that Richard Greico guy that used to be on ""21 Jump Street"", but then he got his own show for just a little while. (Aside, to Kyle) Oh, oh, Chef's movin' in on Ms. Ellen! Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen! Goodbye, Ms. Ellen! I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut! Oh well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate pie, but I left it at home. Oh, man! I wish I knew how to spell!! Nu-uh. Alright, Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing. Oh man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass. Oh hey, Chef. You guys, you know what? My grandma was Dutch-Irish and my grandpa was lesbian! That makes me quarter lesbian! I am TOO!! My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet. This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for THREE HOURS and I still don't feel like a lesbian! I'm a bigger lesbian than you! Wow... Wendy looks just like that chick from grease, Elton John. Damn! Get down! Oh, weak, dude. Did you make love? No way! That's not what we just heard!! What the hell?! Yeah dude, my mom says all I have to do is chow on this box. Booorrrring. (Singing) Day is never finished Masa got me working Some day masa set me free... No, I found it! No, I did, Pip!! Well, guess we'll have to Roshambo for it. Well, first I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can. Then you kick ME in the nuts as hard as YOU can.

I found a magic triangle and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!! Come on! Let me kick you in the nuts for it!! And I told him I said Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts. But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square in the nuts... And he cried like Nancy Kerrigan. Screw you, triangle thief!! HEY!! Oh I'll find it, don't worry!! Goddammit! Give my triangle! Kyle! Seriously! I was just setting it aside. Never! I'll get that triangle if it's the last thing I do!! Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it. Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm not speaking with him. What's that noise? AAGH!! ALIENS!! No, I found it, HE stole it! (To Streisand) I'm not talking to him, because he's a dirty thief. Nu-uh! She was being a total bitch! You scared the crap out of me, Ike! I'm trying to get my triangle -- Wait a minute, I'm not talking to you! Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was just trying to get MY triangle back?!! Well, you can tell Kyle he's a dirty goddamn son of a bitch!! Huh? Hell yeah I do! I got the triangle!

THE WHITE MAN HAS MOCKED MY PEOPLE LONG ENOUGH! YOU KEEP YOUR GODDAMNED MOUTH SHUT!!! (Back to normal) Stan, I need to borrow your bike to ride over to the reservation. My name isn't Eric Cartman. It's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it? Hi, dad! I'm your son, Eric.

Chief Running Water said you got together with my mom at the drunken barn dance. He said you kissed her with your tongue. (Looking sad) So, you're not my dad? WHAT?! So who the hell did that to my mom at the drunken barn dance?!?! No! NOOOO!!!! NO GOD NO!!!!!! (on the monitor) 'Why thank you Polly Prissypants, you are my best friend.' (on the monitoras Polly) 'I think you are one of the coolest people in the world Eric, and you are not fat at all!' Really? You don't think so? (on the monitoras Clydefrog) No you're not fat. All this time... Why didn't you tell me, father? It was YOU all along!! YOU were with my mother the night of the drunken barn dance! Then you DID sleep with my mom? How? REALLY! YOU CAN?! How much? I don't have three thousand dollars! (Very slow and sad) Hey guys. Oh... Fine. How are you guys? Oh, nothing, it's just -- Nothing... Well, I want to know who my dad is. But to find out, they have to do these DNA tests, and that costs three thousand dollars. I don't have three thousand dollars... Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who my father is. I just have to. Maybe I could work at a sweat shop for a while... Well, see you guys, I'm gonna go play in my back yard for a while... You do? You will?! WOW!! You guys are the BEST!!! THANKS, YOU GUYS!!

No way dude, I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song ""Come Sail Away"" by Styx. If I hear the first part I have to finish it. Yeah. I can't do anything until it's done. No! Don't! -- Cause I've got to be free to carry on. Duh-dun (and so on) Yeah, stop being a wuss. Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is!!

Oh man this is fuckin' weak!! (Sarcastic) Oh wow, gee wiz you think so Ma?! Reading sucks ass. (Flipping through) Hey, there's a lot of big words in these books! God, shut up, dude. I don't know, I'm kind of getting a tingly feeling looking at these... (Throwing his voice) Oh, how about Stan? Or Kyle? Ooh... I'm prepared! (Hands behind back) For my book report, I read 'The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe'. It was very very good. Have you read it Mr. Garrison? (Lighting up) Oh, good! (Happily) In 'The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe', a bunch of, uh, hippies walk around and paint stuff. They eat lunch, and then they find a magical... camel, which they have to eat to stay alive. And that's pretty much it, I give it a B minus. Aw, DAMMIT! (Quietly, to Barbrady) Goodie two-shoes!! REALLY? I wanna be a cop! Do I get a nightstick?! 10-4, Sergeant! Hey!

And you WILL respect my authority. GET YOUR ASS TO JAIL! Sweet. Yeah, I've been working this beat for about three days now... You definitely have to have pretty thick skin, or else these people they just walk all over you. Sometimes you have to go undercover to get the worst of 'em. Well hi there. What are you doing tonight? Sir, step out of the car please. Sir, step out of the car. Maybe THIS will teach you to listen to AUTHORITY!!! (To camera) Yeah, sometimes upholding the law is messy. But you get by... ...One day at a time. Sir, could you step out of the car please? And, uh, who, who's in here with you? (To camera) Poor people tend to live in clusters. Nothing. Now, sir, is there some kind of -- Okay, let's try to watch the language. There's children present here. (To camera) Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. (To parents) RESPECT MY AUTHORITY!!! (To himself) Chickenlover... DAMMIT! Can't this thing go any faster?!?! FREEZE! Put your hands in the air!! I got reports that the suspect is in this area. Ah-HA!! But he is not listening to my AUTHORITY!! Ohhh...

El Commandant Cartman has ways of making you talk! What are you guys doing? A clubhouse? Heheh, that's the lamest thing I've ever heard! Wwwhy?? That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse! Fine!

Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now. And stop your bitchin! So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan? We'll see about that.  Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny. Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education. Look at it, Kenny! It is the greatest clubhouse ever built! And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny. All right. You go find chicks, Kenny. Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of expenses. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!  Mom? Can I watch American Gladiators? What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon? Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse? Holy crap!  Behold! The Ewok Village 2000! Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage? Or a tasty snack? How's the clubhouse coming, Stan? Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over. It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole. Ahaw, that's weak. That's killer. That's totally weak! Sweet. Killer weak sweet! I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, ""Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gona fingerpaint!"" Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts! Coming, Mom.  Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick! Who the hell are you?! How many people? Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare? This is bullcrap! This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse! Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Wwow! Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?

I only need one, dude. I only need one. How much is it? Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twnety-five. Oh come on, you guys. We still have plenty of money left over. I'm right! Eh! God-damnit! I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me! Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money.  Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet! I think we're almost to the end. How much? Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet. What? This is cool. It is, too! Aah, three dollars.

Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny?  Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor. Whoa, dude, look over there!  Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys! Okay.  Kugheek! Oh my God,  it smells like ass out here.

I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainfoest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast! Food! I have to have food! Chicken wings. Medium spicy. Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin? Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again? Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't- What the hell happened to him? I'm gonna be Jesus! Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?! Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home! Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't. Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God. This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak. Peter! Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess. Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.

But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do. Hey, yeah!  Ow! Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy. Can I have the yellow with a side of white? I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. Ow! My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean. Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is. Bitch, I hate that bitch! Stop calling me piggy! So, what does that mean? All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair  and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands! Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me. I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave! Ow! Son of a bitch! Hey dudes.  Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses!

After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again! No, not with my eyes. With these!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha! You guys, listen to this song I just wrote. It's called, ""I Hate You Guys"": I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom. I have to go number two. No way, dude! What would I wipe with? Well what do I sit on? God, I'm glad you guys know all these ""pooping outside"" rules!  Urgh. Come on, now. Stop, you guys! I can't think!

God! Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature! You mean the other jakovasaur? You're a jakovasaur; that's what they call you. But the other jakovasaur talked different. I have to call my friends over; they're never gonna believe it. He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left. Will you stop with the whole ""mom smoking crack"" thing?! It's a old joke! No, that was a jakovasaur. It's okay to come in. Jakov, I want you to meet my friends. Hahahahaheh, isn't he funny? We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend. No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves. Haaahahahah. You're so funny, Jakov. ""Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."" I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. ""Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."" Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction. You know, there's really only two seasons here in South Park: Winter, and July, heh heh heh. But, but um, seriously, South Park has always been a place of discovery for me...  Ey, you sons of bitches! Get back here! I'm having a god-damned distinctive honor! If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct. Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better! Aren't they cute, you guys? I like going to school now. Jakovasaurs are so cool. Hey, Jakov, how's it going? Moving? You... can't leave. You're my friend. Jakov, please don't go.  You make everything in South Park fun.  You brought life to this whole town. It would suck without you. Yes. These people, Jakov, these people need you. I need you. Please, Jakov. Stay? Hoo-ray! Jakov is staying, you guys! Yes. Who would take care of them? I have authoriteh? Well, that should be fine, just fine. Fine. Hi, Jakov.  What the hell is that? Who's laughing? Wow, that's cool. I can help you get ready. What are we doing out here, you guys? I wanna see if Jakov wins that game show. Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species.  Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine. That's Kenny with branches on his head. Why did you bring me all the out here, you guys? Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix! Jakov! Open this door! I am Department of Interior guy, and I have authoritah!  No! Jakov, don't go! Well... Fine. Don't, mother! Just, don't. No. That's okay. I'll see you guys. Ooooohh. Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class. Told ya! I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class? You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is. Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass. Yeah, I'll bet. Five bucks. Craig, could I talk to you real quick? Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater. Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it. I don't Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you. No, no! Craig, you you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today. You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked. Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?! Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny! Those sons of bitches! Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek! Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week! Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom. Egh. God-damnit!  Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig. Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed. Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow? After Red Racer, of course. However long Craig wants it to last. T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge. Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something. Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch! When I have you guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world. Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000 You're gonna be eating those words, asshole. Come on! What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other. You just hit each other, smack each other around. I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek. Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys!  I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts! Fine! Fine, that's fine! I'm ready!  Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool. Respect my authoritah! Dude. Come on, now. Come on. I win! Hey, may be.

Come on, Craig! Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass! Come on, Craig! 'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it. Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad. Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss youare, Craig. When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind. I think Sexual Harassment Panda is cool. What did you call me? That does it!

I'm hungry!  Ow! You can't hit me! Didn't you see those nanny videos on TV? You're not allowed to have people over! This is bullcrap!  I can't reach the freezer! God damnit!  Shut up, Kitty!  Any problems, contact Eric's Mommy at 303... Aha!  I'm gonna call mom and tell her that the babysitter is having her boyfriend come over! Then we'll see who's the turd! Damnit! Ey! I need to use the phone! Ey! Aaah! Uh-ow! Ah! I'm gonna get her, Kitty! Mark my words!! SHUT THE HELL UP, KITTY!! They mostly come at night, mostly. Ey, I was watching Aliens on TV! Who the hell are you? You know this guy? Christ, he's like 50 years old! Dude, that's not cool. Dude, when my mom finds out that my babysitters have their boyfriends over, she mostly gets really mad, mostly. Yaaah. Eeyy! Ey, God damnit! Hey, what are you doing? I'm gonna tell my mom on you. Ey! You ate all the pizza! That does it! I'm calling my mom right now, and bustin' your ass! Give me that phone number! I am not gonna be bossed around by a chick!  Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelley had a boyfriend over. God damnit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip. Okay, okay, I'm finding the catnip. Aha, charade you are! Looks like you're the turd now! Aaaaa!  Yes! I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home! You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can prove you had a boyfriend over heuh! What should we do, Artemus Clyde Frog? Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog.  Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your collar.  You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come home and save me.  Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope!  That's it! That's it, Mr. Kitty! Oh! God damnit! Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?! You just want me to open the door! What?? Ih is she okay? Huh?! Aha! I knew it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture! Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it! O-kay! Let's see heuh. Haha! Um... Aw, damnit!  AAAAH! Aw, man, you guys suck.

The meteor shower. They mostly come every few years, mostly. Well, I just, I kind of like having you around. No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family. I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could pretend like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, we could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day. Yuh, you mean it? Hooray!  Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly. Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother is away at a party right now. That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelley Marsh, who is twelve. I'm just thinking out loud.  Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelley's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh? I'm sorry. Did you say something, Skyler? Agh! Gotcha! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Well, Shelley, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway? You're not ugly. Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls? Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know. If you want, I could help you. Just let me get my cowboy hat. Okay, it's clear. We don't have much time! Hurry up in there! That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face! Oh my God! You are all very bad kitties! That is a bad, bad kitty! Come on, kitties. Outside. Come on. That's it. Come on, come on.  Uh oh. Yeah. I think we get along okay. Heh.  Mom! Uh I can explain. It was all Shelley's fault! She didn't watch the cat! Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush. That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West.

You son of a bitch chicken from outer space... thing, come back here! No, Kitty! These are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders! No, Kitty! No, Kitty.

Well, I can't find anything- wait. What's this? Oh, my God, this guy again. Oh! Aww!  Oh, weak! Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house! Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off? No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries. Well, he hasn't been here yet. Where's this? Ey! I'm the leader of Earth! Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true! No, never. It's perfect. Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait! Forget him! He's done for! No, no, he's done for. Come on!

Well, it's for those reasons we wanna help our friend Marvin now. Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you. She bought it. Wait. I remember. It was the red button! Alright, Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh. What? We're not gonna come visit him.

Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win. Yes we are! Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month. Right. Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield. Yeahah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War. Yippie! Long live the Confederacy! Hooray for the South! But why? Why should they get the bell? But we don't have to lose. Gentlemen, we can win this battle! Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, ""We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!"" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, ""Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!"" God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah! So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet? I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot. Perhaps we should take Topeka. They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah. No. I say we take Topeka. I'll bet you can't. I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies! Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month. Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedon, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens. Excuse meh. Dear guys. Dear Ms. McCormick Where did the Confederates go, son? Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go. Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em. Where are you going? We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter! No! What about the Confederasuh?!

Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take. Yes! Yes! Take the fort! Suck my ass! We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reenforcements are bound to show up. I knew they would! Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.! Dear Mr. President: I don't. I made it up.

Jews... play stupid games. Jews... that's why they're lame. And Time to go, Mr. Hankey. You guys! You guys!  Guess what? I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys! Yes! I really did. Well, because yesterday I got my period. My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month. Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture.  I got my period, and you guys didn't. I got my period, and you guys didn't. Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people.  Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm.  Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh.  Oh, this one's got wings, you guys! Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's eve.  But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear. Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny? Tampon? What's a tampon? Ew, doesn't that hurt? Wow, cool! All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this ""Women Who Run With The Wolves"" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers. Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's eve!  Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others. Okay, is everyone accounted for? Goddess Wind? Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?! And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool. Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first. What's the matter, Kyle? ...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too. Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us. Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet. Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew. Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go. Now, the word is ""spirituality."" I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she- Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has- God damnit, Kenny, shut the hell up! Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people. Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there. Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas. That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long. Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh. That was pretty cool. Okay, how about this one, Kenny? No? How about this? Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this? We're trying to find the brown noiseü¾³¤¼it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control. That's a scientific term for crapping your pants. Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II! How about this one, Kenny? That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter. Stan, what's a queef? Of course we know what a queef is, you queef! Aaaa- Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it! I told you guys! Here it is, right here. ""The brown noise."" ""An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen."" See? That means crap your pants. ""The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb."" What does that mean? How about geebo, or, or mung? Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise. You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys! The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look. There, okay. Let's see here.  Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny? Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch. Okay. I told you guys! That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally. Ooooh. They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously. Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this. Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants infront of everybody, you guys. Uh-oh. Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay? Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars!  She's only given me a lousy quarter before! Yeah! This is so tits! Oh, I mean, this is so cool! Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard! Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later!  Aw, man, this is so tits! Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this!  Oh my God, you guys, seriously! Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich!  Aren't you stoked?! Look what the tooth fairy left me last night! For one tooth. Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits. Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a  Sega Dreamcast. All we need is teeth. Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a  Sega Dreamcast? Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits! I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us.  ""Oh, thank you, guys."" You're welcome, Kenny. How are we gonna get it from him? Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha. Higher, you guys. Agh! Careful, you assholes!  To the left, you guys, left.  No, camera left, camera left!  That's it, now down. I am the tooth fairy, my child. Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow. Ey! Do not open your eyes until morning. Or else I will kick you in the nuts. Square in the nuts. Bull's eye! I love that song, Mom. Sing it again. Okay. Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy. I know, huh? You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys! I mean- Four dollars. Do you what this means? Tih-  Tooth?  What the hell? Mom! You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police! You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. ""There's no tooth fairy."" I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh...  M- Mom? Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy? How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face? How can I trust you?  How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself.  Myself and Willikins Bear, of course. No, Mother! No more lies! There is no money. I know! You guys...  Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this. You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it. My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money. But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny.  Don't touch me, Kenny. Kyle, open your eyes, man!

I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house. Been on the inside for so long, I don't rermember how to live on the outside.

Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes? Sweet. Hey, Romper Stomper. Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too.

Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars. ...You see.  Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature! I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here , and all my friends are down here . Nononono! Me h'myah , you guys myah! ü¾³¤¼ maybe a little mo down, down in hyah. SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME. I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog. Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog!  I can meet new friends on the Internet!  Here's a chat room: ""Men Who Like Young Boys"" That's perfect.  Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li-  Wow!

Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face.  ""Meet me at Mel's Buffet restaurant tomorrow morning.""  Sounds good. See you then! Clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face.  You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gaonna meet my first mature friend! Hi, are you Tony? Yeah! Wow, cool! Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends ; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now. Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks. Huh? What the hell just happened? Okay, we'll try this again.  Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to-  Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy.  Hello, HungDaddy. ""Hi. I'm eight and a hal inches."" Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf.  Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets. Midgets piss me off. Frowny face.  Lemme see, how about this one? Mister Hammerhead? Mr. Garrison?? You wanna be my friend? That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first? Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys! Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?! No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being ""mys-teriously"" arrested, huh?! I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me! Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?! YES I AM!! Dr. Mephesto, I need help. You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me. Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys! NAMBLA? Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto! Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool? Sure. ...Sweet. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't! Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all.  It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Thanks, dude. Really? Awesome! Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature,  excluding Stan and Kyle, of course. KIIICK ASS! Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor. We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go. You can't go. No, you CAN'T go.  Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out What the hell?  Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only! Hunh.  Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA. Thank you. Thank you very much.  Thank you. They're all over the place. Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out. Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and and... take one for the team.  And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters. Now, are you a team player or not?! Well, Butters, there is no I in ""team."" Just go, Butters. We're running out of time. Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass. Well, what? Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There. No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long. Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher. (Here.)  Oh, hoho. Ow. Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man! Huh? Not with me, man. He's fakin'! But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle. ""Coming in for attack, Captain."" Pipew, pipipew  Give me the space cruiser, Kenny. Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser  so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5. No, mine. M'yah!  Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha  bluh oh, ha-ow! Yeah. Okay, mom. What's goin' on, guys? Oh-kay. Uh huh. Oh, I think I see where this is going. Stan, why don't you just ask the question?  CARTMAN No no, no no, nono no! Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price. I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle? Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars. What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah. ""Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire."" Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah! No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies! Shut up, Fluffy! Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp! whatwhatwhatwhat?  Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?! Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000! I do! I do care! Look how much.  Look. Look how much I care. Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA!  That son of a bitch! Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney! It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay! Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before. You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in!  Please. No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE! Thank you. Heh. Hey, what what's going on? Huh? Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF! Thaaat's ri-ight. Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys! Yes I do! Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home! It's okay, I'm here. Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever. The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy. Mmmm. You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again? Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on? Whoa! Calm down, ho. I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone! Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts! You won't let me help. ...Touchü¾¼. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, just... tell me what to do, and I'll do it.  Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih.  Wendih. Seriouslih.  The Bog Monster speaketh. Uh huh. Why don't we just talk about the swastika? I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,... obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it. Yeah. Cool. Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make ""quadruple stuffs."" No way! Me neither. Huh. Whoa. Ur, s-sorry.  Go ahead. Ahh! Okay, It will be like this forever. Me, too!  CARTMAN  CARTMAN Yes! Yes! Yes, I'm a star! I'm a star! I'm-  Aaawww, I'm nobody! God-damnit! Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign from God. That's it, isn't it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million, don't you? That's it! Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives.  God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million. Boy band. Boy band. There's nothing faggy about $10 million, asshole! This was a message from God! That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass!  I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over! Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall. So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it-! So? What? Damnit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning! Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know. We'll let you know, Butters. Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off! Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd better do it better than that.  Next! Kyle's brother?? Chist's sake! Next! Next audition! GOD-DAMNIT, NEXT! Not the next song, the next PERSON! Aw, man, this is gonna be a long-ass day. No way! Okayokay, fine! WOW me! Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh. Dude, she's a CHICK! Nobody's gonna notice?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?! Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up! Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse? We have to rehearse all that we can! Now, check this out:  My mom made us costumes! Yeah.  This one's yours, Stan. 'N this one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters... 'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, 's tough. ...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not- You can't be the tough one, because you're Jewish! Since when?! Alright, fine! Here!  Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this! I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you...  pretend to use your finger like a gun or something. Okay, Kenny, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, then? ...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4,-! Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We nned energy! We need to be up! We're goin' to see the mall manager. But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do, so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the- uh.  Aaaa! Aaaa! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-damnit! Oh, God, I can't see! The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on! Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimetary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up. Alright, guys, here we go.  Hello, sir! We... are Fingerbang! We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall. Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition? Alright! Let's do it, boys!  CARTMAN -you're my fantasy, you fanta- Woll. So, can we play here? No?? Why not?! You don't think we're any good, do you?! Well, come on guys. We gave it our best. Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems. I just don't know what I'm gonna do. Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me. Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean,  I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know? What's the Gomlich effect. So how do boy bands use that? Thanks! Cucumber in the pants. Got it. Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, ""Oh my God, it's Fingerbang. Oh my God."" Okay? I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera. Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck. Waitwaitwaitwait, CUT! Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo Di Caprio! Fine! Who would you go crazy for? ...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer. Roll camera! Jesus Christ! Aaand CUT.  Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what ve've got! Oh uh, Kyle has it. Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. Hello again! I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video. If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed! Uh God damnit! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool. Son of a bitch! You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease. Really? You will? That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock? Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed! Aw, mom! Where the hell is Stan?! I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will HAVE HIS NUTS! Yes. Yes, sir, any secondü¾³¤¼we're just waiting on one more member. Yeah. We'll start right away.  We'll have to do it without him. Oh, God-damnit! God damnit! People are walking away! Just another minute. Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard. Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name! Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please? We will!  Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy band of the countrih! Someday you will all be among those who can say, ""I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall.""  And so, without further ado, all five members of the... No! He can't be dead! No! We were so close! But we have to perform! Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang! Chuh!  Yes! Yes! Thank youuuu, yes! Ok- Okay okay Okay, yeah, maybe.  God. Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us. I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', ""Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!"" Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation.  This sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation."" ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation to increase the population of the younger generation."" No no, no. Separation. Ugh! Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom. A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe? Yeah, what if we haven't? Jesus was made of crackers? So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers. Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly! Nno! But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right? Oh yeah, okay. Right, I already got that one. Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins. No, you're already going to hell. You are, too! Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault. What'd we do to Timmy? Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed. How was it? Huh? Who's in there? Well, here goes everything. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass... And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right? Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating. No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it. Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week. And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog.  And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of-  -eh- Ow!  D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow!  Eh! Oh! Help. Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here! Uh-huh-  Oho! Ohoho. I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God.  He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously. Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh! Turn around so I can clean out your ass. What? Oh, now you've said it, too! Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again. Ugh. Oh, I know.  We can use Wacky Water Weasel! And he never took Communion! Yeah. Come on, hurry up! What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die! I'm first, I'm first! What the? You're doing unnatural things in the house of God! Oh, this guy is so gonna burn! Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves! We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh!  If thy hand offend thee, cut it off!  It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed- -than having two hands to go into hell-uh,- -into the fire that will never be quenched! Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves! I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The LORD is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh! Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was  smacked down by the Lord-uh!  God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell. So when will you go?! Tomorrow?! Ten years?! Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh!  But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides,  so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya  to this part hmya . Who will help us? Praise God-uh! This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed. Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants. No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, oh temptress! This is a distraction from our work on the church!  Do not think that you can tempt us with toys  and new games and tidings of powdered dougnut pancake surprise! For it is the AFTERLIFE we have concerned ourselves with!  Not the pleasures of this earth, but salvarion in the world aftah!! Let us get back to our work at the church Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah. Hello? Oh my God!! It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave! Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail! Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh.  It was our departed friend, Kennih! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh.  He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish. He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh! And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh! We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh! Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?! The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins! Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry, Whatever we did, we're sorry. Let's see. Matthew 15:11. ""Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes OUT of the mouth defileth a man."" That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting. Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. Sister, have you read this book. Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh. Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true? We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus! Whoa. Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?! Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?! That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh! Theah! Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya? Praise the Lord-uh! For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person!  This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk! We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh! Devil be  GOAN-uh! Now WALK, Timmih! Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh! The Lord wants you to walk,Timmih! Oo-WALK, Timmih! He walks-uh! Yes! Praise the Lord! For he is Lord, Lord Lord Lord. Where are you from, little boy? And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it? Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! For he is Lord, Lord Lord Lord. Right here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?! He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at!  Bah! Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say ""Amen!"" Halleluyah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar! So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah , and putting a dollar in the box-ah!  Come on, don't be shy! Come on now! Yeess.  Yeess.  It worked, you guys, it actually worked! Eheverybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all! Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars!  Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route. It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school. Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that. My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow! Suck my balls! Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! Sister Anne is a blasphemer! Uh oh. Jesus, ixnay on the oolschay. Ee-yes, by doing that,  and, putting a dollar in the box-uh! No, come back! You face everlasting damnation!  Wait! No! No!  I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit! You're gonna send me to hell? Aw, crap! Yeah,  get out of here! There, that's better. U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her. Why, that's PERfect! Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks? KISS MY ASS!!!  Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak. Oh, I'm sure I do. I'm trying. Fantastic, then. You guys are all such pussies! Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted. Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we'er starting to see just how special it was. I wish I was sstill there. Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it. Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how! Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade. Suck my balls!!!  Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously- We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick! We didn't feel like it! Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen? We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa! You're damn right they do! Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him? Who the hell cares?! God, these guys are such geek dumbasses! Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me. Yes! We've had a new time maching built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck  Au revoir, teacher! Perheps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen? There it is! Come on, everybody! No way, lady! You can suck my balls! ...What? Touchü¾¼, teacher. Touchü¾¼. What?? Hey, dudes, check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultrakeeper Futura 2000!  Yeah, well , it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's, flat-screen TV, and of course, On-Star. Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepeh- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase. He's not a genius, he's a little douche bag. Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume. Yeah, that's me. Yeahhh, you already know about it?? Well! ""Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"" Here, Kyle. And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically.  I can take something as simple as this calculator and... Trapper Keeper? Hybrid with Wellington Bear Calculator. And now it can use Wellington Bear Calculator, too. Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers.  If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands. Oh really?  Then, why don't you hold it?  Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it.  Hold it. Hold it. I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once. Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend, It doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me. Okay, that's cool. Ah- alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some- . Ugh. Ey! You son of a bitch!  Wait a minute. Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device. Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready! It was NOT a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S2000! And if-!  There he is! Got ya! Aah, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you? Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done. ...You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener? What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?! Aw, damnit!  Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes! Hey, dudes. Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a NEW one!  So everything worked out. Why the hell not?! Wait... sso then you guys burned my last one for no reason! But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one. Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think?! I think this whole thing is a SETUP! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else?! Screw you guys, I'm going home! Ech! Screw you guys, home! Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away. Oh! Cool. Whoa. ...Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass! I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get- Screw you guys, screw you guys. Screw you guys, scr- Huh? Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now? What are you doing, Kyle? I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle. Hey-eh, screw you. Ahh! Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines! No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene! God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't suposed to talk! How good? Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play! That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey! This is gonna be the best version of the Miracle Worker ever! Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les Misü¾¼rables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks. Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey!  What the hell is that? And where... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey? Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Kyle? Why do you do these things to me? You say, ""No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!"" Cool! Can you get it for us? I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular! But  Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man. Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to ""Phantom Of The Opera""?! Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice. Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me! OP-pression! Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks? Yeh. Whoa. Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody!  Where the hell is Timmy? Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged turkey. No, Timmy! Tha handicapped turkey does not go in our play! No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part. Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys! Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonnan do?! Dude, we need your turkey for our play! I know, I know, but listen: uhlet me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy? I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it. Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show? Oh. Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything. Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second.  Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2  stand just a little bit more over...  here.  Let's see, maybe a little more up in here.  And just a wee bit over here.  And right about...  hm'ere. There we go. Good. Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light! Calm down! Calm down! We can have special effects, too. Now, I know a lot is going wrong, but we've got to stick together to make this play work!  All of us! Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see.  no  No.  NO!  God-damnit Terrible!  I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me. Like what? Hey, that's not a bad idea. Oh, man! No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes. Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire!  Yes! Yes! I have it now! Alright everybody, let's take our places! I don't know.  I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole. Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights. Union Mafia bastards! Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller! ...Alright, fine! Get in costume! What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing! Okay, we're ready for the-  What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire! They loved it! They LOVED it! I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen? Whoa! That totally surprised me!  I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.

Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up oour ass. Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again! Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free. We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run?

But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight! What?! Well, screw you, fatasses! No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies! Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care! Well, I guess you're screwed, then. Well, you... could make them... go away for a while. Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away. Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you. I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months. You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like,  ""my parents molestered me."" No, but you've gotta cry, like this: ""My parents molestered me.""  And then they'll say somethng like, ""Was it a good touch or a bad touch?"" and you say  ""Ih, it was a good touch"" or- no wait,  you say it was a bad touch. Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer ""bad touch."" Yeah, And cry.  Oh, he's ready. Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us! You guys! Come out here! Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town.  They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please?  Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions. Parents?  Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around. Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah! Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service. Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat. So, it appears that you need me. Which is good, because... I need you, too. Ringy-ding? Aaahh!  You sons of bitches!  You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need. Where is your husband? Seize her! Outlander! Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair! Butters, calm down, ahright? I believe you have something of ours, outlander!

We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys! Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat. What?! I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT! You know, first thing in the mornng when it just won't come out? ...deh.OOOWW!!! Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks. Don't call me fat, buttfucker. Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold! Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways!  Screw you guys, I'm goin' home! I say we help Santa Claus! Thank you, thank you. What are you talkin' about, ""quit""? Huh! I don't remember that. I guess- we might as well- go home now. Yeah, ham. Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?! Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents. You goys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!! I was just-  I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial. So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama. You'll never guess. Guess. You ready?  Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say,  ""Shit."" It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude. Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it. Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said ""shit!"" On television! Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina? Goddamnit, when are they gonna say ""shit""?! I'm sure they're just holding it till the very last scene. Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome! Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch? Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs. Huh? I don't get it. Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word! Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina. Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of ""shit."" We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob. You know, that stuff you get as a appetizer at Thai food restaurants. ""meecrob"" is way grosser than ""shit,"" dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket fullof shit before I ate another plate of meecrob. Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob. Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go. Detective Sandy Vagina here thinks that ""shit"" might have something to do with everyone getting sick You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This... could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina. So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb. Oho, gross! Kenny's got it. heh heh. Goddamnit, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me! But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right? I knew it! Meecrob!  Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do! My house, too? Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in its vagina! What a stupid voice. So please, everyone, From now on you've got to try and watch your language. That's not funny! Jesus Christ! Yeah, he's excited. Hey, Butters. Hey yeah! Yeah, and we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale. Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale.

Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club? Cool. Heheh, guess who I am, guys? Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blainetology is for everyone. There are Blainetologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew. Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you. Cool. Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you? Oh, you see, that, that's inteesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often. He's going to eat his own head. Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person. No you're not. No you're not. No you're not. No you're not. Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize. Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him. What's he doin' here? Now how the hell did he do that? Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die! No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh? Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest? What? Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either.

CARTMAN What- What are you doing??  No!.. wuh...why? Noooooooooo! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu! Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming.  I know that you are all deeply troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman once and for all!  Yes, Clyde! Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge! Did you guys see that movie Hannibal? Where the deformed guy trained giants pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony , we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's weiner.  It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his weiner bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!! What? Oh, right. Why should we care?  Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, ""It's not your problem."" But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, ""You may take our pride, but you'll naver take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!""  Now who's with me?!! Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy! There we go.  Come and get it.  ...Come on, pony, bite the weiner. Bite it. Come on, good pony. That's it!  Now, bite it off! Bite off the weiner! Good pony!  Oh no, pony, he'll like that. No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off. He said it was okay. Because  of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer! Not like that, pony! Whattayou mean? How do I do that? I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goaddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!! Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead! You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a winner... So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a li'l ol' scheme  that involves them. Whoa! I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra. Radiohead. Yes, of course. Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all? Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown. Everyone's gonna be there! You're welcome, Scott. Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we? That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid.  Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too.  I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys? Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott? Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to.  Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool! Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott. Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA! What a retard!  And now everyone saw it! I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink. That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!! Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!!  Then... that...  Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!! Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out! How to get Scott Tenorman back! I just finished planning a brilliant li'l scheme  that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars. It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right? So, I realized, ""What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?"" right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman ü¾³¤¼ and ü¾³¤¼ see him get his weiner bitten off by a pony! Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's weiner in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!!  Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! ...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!!  Ready, pony?  Bite it! Yes!! Hello, Scott! I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides.  Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally! Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott.Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride! Oh, it will be very neat, Scott. A little penis-biting, perhaps? Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott? Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott.  Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good. Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival! Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks! What's so funny? Not yet, but they will be. Hey, Chef. What contest? Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here. Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony! Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive. Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first.  Goddamnit! Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine. Alright.  Hey, this is great! Gawh, this is really good, Scott! What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's.  It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap.  I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your weiner. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do somethng to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area. I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your weiner bitten off. You would most likely send your parents.  And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies... After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili.  Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott?  I call it, ""Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."" Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! Whoa, bummer, dude. Are you sure? I haven't seen it. You guys! Hey you guys! You guys! Awesome! Give me mine! Well yeah, dude. Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip! I think this new guy's funny. Aw, dude, gay! Racist! Don't talk to us, kid. Kenny's a random slut. Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there! Weak. Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents! Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies. We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us. Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie! Alright! Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay! Mom, it's 3:30! This is taking up my whole Saturday! Why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day? God! She didn't take this long to die! Great! Now can we go?! Ogh! God-damnit!! Mom, I wanna go home! Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh! Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?! Hoosajiggawha? Uh yah sir, excuse me: Du- Does this mean that I... have... one... million dollars? Nonowait, you don't understand:  since I was th-three years old it has been my dream to have one million dollars Egh. Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint green from its surface. I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it. On my dream.  On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember... Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it. Huh, I think God has plenty of money. Not much, just taking my  one million dollars out of the bank. Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make. HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloadeers are gonna take my hard-earned cash! Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch! My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure. What?! Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come. No no no! I'm buying it to keep people out!  Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks. But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds,  The rides are great, but... All the lines, lines, LINES!  If there's one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!!  And then there get to be so many people  that they make FastPass. So then there's lines for FastPass. You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it. Gentlemen, I thank you. Yyeessss! Yyeessss!  Awesome!  Ho ho! Sweet!  Yes!  Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seatbelts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft! Yes!  Yes!  Oh, cool!  Oh, look how much fun I had!  Whoa! Heheheheh.  Ah! Heheh.  Whoa! Heh, heheh.  Woooo, Adventure Island! Check it out! Awesome!  Yoohoo! Yeh-hehess!  Yehess!  I'm so happy! I'm so happy! Hey, everybody! Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides , six roller coasters , and tons of great surprises!  And the best part is:  You can't come!!  That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister , a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow!  It's the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!!  So come on down to Cartmanland now!  But don't plan on getting past the parking lot,  'cause remember: So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come!  Especially you, Stan and Kyle. Whoa! Heheh.  Whoa!  Whoa! Heheheheheh. Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the-uum, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh. What the hell? You sons of bitches! What the hell are you doing?! That's right! You stay out! ...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight! Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them. But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line. Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines. But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park. Ugh. Two people? Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park... Sweet. Alrightalright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day. I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in. The rest of you will just have to try another day. 'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland. ...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland. Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides.  Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again! Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah-  What are you doing? Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now? Ugh, alrightalright, hang on.  Security! Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it. But I don't know how it works. Ogh, alrightalright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person. Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day.  However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood?  Alright, let's go. Wait a minute! Who are you? HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan! I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY! Get him out of here! Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides!  Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared!  AAAAaaaa.... ...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day...  Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to... God-damnit!  Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today! Eh!  Goddamnit, stop running into me! AGH!  DAAAAAAH!! Hey, there you are! Just give me my money back. I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park! You call this great?! I call it Hell! Trade me back, Goddamnit! GODDAMNIT GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass! Yeah? He- Hey, that's my money! What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time! Yeh- You can't take my money, Goddamnit! No! But I don't... ah... ah...  Hey! Hey Mr. Foon, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back. But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park I lose everything! This can't be happening! AAAAAHH!! It isn't fair!  You Goddamned assholes, it isn't fair! You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?! I'M SO PISSED OFF! Ey! You used to work for me!  Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonfofabitch! Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks! Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out! No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on! Watch this. It's sooo funny.  Come 'ere, dog, come on.  Good dog.  Red rocket red rocket.  Red rocket. Red rocket. Come on. I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk. Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it.  Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket!  Ohooohhh I told you guys. Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away. That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off.  Don't you guys know anything? Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it-hey come here, dog. Dog, come here! AIDS? Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that. Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?! Just put it on, Butters. Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering? I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on! Do you feel protected? Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier. I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up. So I don't get AIDS. I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face! Here, talk to them, Butters. Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence. Oh, bitch! Ew, Butters? You're in big trouble now. Let a man take a crap! I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that?  You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper. Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody. Look.  But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through. Why? Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive. This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?!  You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller. Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys! Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere. Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere. Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it. Bring it, bring it! Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih. Date-rape psychosis. Awesome! We shouldn't have this many responsibilities!

Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?! You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time! I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid! Yeah, and you're a towel! We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we? Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level. Could you turn it up? Hup hup. Come on, hang on. Kenny! Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there! Hooray! ...Not really. Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip Scissors. Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those? God-damnit! HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads! Oh, I'm sorry, but I though we were at war with these assholes! That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents?  Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We're not the ones bombing them now, we're- we're jsut kids.  There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault. Yes, but they're sand monkeys! God-damnit, I hate regular milk!!! Heh, four dollars for a goat? We got ripped off. Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it. It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't stay here, or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom. Oh no, not Towelie. No, we don't wanna get high!! That's right! Stan, if you're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd like to go now, please? Aw, son of a bitch! Uh ho, you guys. It didn't smell that bad; you guys are overreacting. Uh, whatever! Oh, I'm sorry! Next time I'll just ask my fart nicely if it wouldn't mind staying tucked away for a while! God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist! What is this? The freakin' Flintstones? It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in America, so we brought it back to your crappy country. What did you call us?! I told you! Jawas have no heart. You know, sand people. God, I hate you so much, Stan! Ey, what the hell are you talking about?! I'm not a god-damned Canadian, and neither are you! Dude, don't call me a Canadian! Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive animal lover. He's got a boner for this goat, a- Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay? It's not expensive. I'm gonna go take care of this prick! He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people. Mehah...  What's up, bin Laden? Uh oh, 5:30, time to pray.  Allah, Allah, m'heh Uh oh! Mmm-mm! Hey look! An infidel!

I just had the greatest idea... ever! Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton? Yes, I have it right hmya. You will?  Ah.  Oh, ah, thank you for your help. Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye. Brown eye! And, and big rosy cheeks! Full cheeks!

Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God. Okay, okay, so get this, get this: The milk company calls me, right?  And they call me and say that two people from Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think it's their kid. No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be! Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!!  Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh.  Just- okay  No. Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh. Oh God. Oh my... God. You guys, something's wrong. I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse. It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded.  I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got? Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever? Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything. You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die... This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car poicture and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh. So does that mean I'll never laugh again? Ugh. Oh, dude, oh. Nothing's wrong with me. Uh- Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here! Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor. I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh. Okay, let me have it. Okay, why? ...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing. Who's there? Orange who? ...naw, that didn't work either. Who's there? An interrupting cow who Dear Mom:  CARTMAN  CARTMAN What's goin' on? Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call him Ben Assfleck.  Ben Assfleck, say that's funny. Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck! A-heh, what? E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse. Whatever. All I know is that I can laugh again. I'm gonna go home and eat another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny! What's that thing? What? Forty bucks? Alrigh, alright. Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls? Cold be tough. But I'll give it a shot. ...Oh, man. Uh, it's nice to meet you, Kyle. I can certainly tell you're a relative of my good friend Kyle here. Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it. I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars! Ugh, ugh! Oh! Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit! Kyle, Kyle!  I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were sent to concentration camps. Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea. No, I'm seriously! Becuase, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, ""Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?"" And I was all like, ""No way!"" And this little light went on in my head like, ""Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin."" But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  What a misunderstanding, huh? Goddamnit, give me another chance! Haha,  serves you right, asshole. He's faaahn. 1, 2, 3, 4... He's faaahn. Heheheheheh. I I, I learned that... you shouldn't judge somebody because... that-no, wait. Stand by, please. Oh, God-damnit! Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature. Oh GOD-DAMNIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS! I'll make you eat your parents! Nothing! Aw, that is such bullcrap! No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Token was able to do all that is because his family is rich! Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?! Let's just see where Token's clothes come from, shall we?  Ooooo, Armani Exchange! All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Token?!  I didn't think so! Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars. Hey, you changed your clothes, Token. Not too expensive for Token's rich ass family, apparently. Oh, well, let me take this disk up to the Enterprise and see if Captain Kirk can decrypt it. Oh, Jesus, dude. What in the hell are they doing? Well, let's just play our game, then. Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny! Kick his nutsack! Uh huh. Yeah. Hey! Ey, you did me already! Pussy. My baby takes the morning train and she takes another home again. Hmm. What do we have heah? Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it! Guess what I have sitting in my back yard? Better. Better. Better. Thirty-three aborted fetuses.  Oh yes. Mint condition, tax free. Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle! Stem cells, numbnuts! It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest. Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own! Hello. Is this theee University of Colorado Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand you're corrently doing research on stem cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in possession of somesah aborted fetuses that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty dollars a pound right now. ...How about a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my balls- I, I'll think about it. Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyam? Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment? You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch ...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already! Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! God-damnit! Come on, Jack, you gotta be able to offer me more than that. ...Yes, I realize there's a ban on stem-cell research, but I've got thirty-some-odd human fetuses in my backyard! I'm sure there's other research your company can do with them. ...You'll take one? Okay, how much for one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my balls here, Jack. Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three feti; I've gotta sell the rest before they spoil. Buh, alright.  eh Butters? Are you through databasing the clientele sheet? Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit. Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list. What is this, a PTA meeting? In the ...hospital? Why? Die? Kenny? Yeah. Yeah, of course. We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter. Heh, sorry. ...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know. Dont you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay! Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's goin' down, Jew-boy? No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just uh.  Oh man. I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure Doctor, can you tell me exactly how stem cells work? Not at all, but go on. My God... So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? Ihin other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue. Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat! Hmmm. Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind. There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves. Oh, doctor.  Thanks. Thanks. Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind. My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds.  I love Kenny McCormick and... I want you to love him too.  And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we can sell your fetus to compnaies like Alder Labs. Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill. Great, just sign right here, please. Hi. Havin' an abortion today?  Great. Listen, if you'd like to sell your abortion for research I'm offering uh, seventy-five dollars. Help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there.  And you sign right here.  Uh excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus? Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life. Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance. You guys! Come quick! It's...  Why, it's a miracle, you guys! Look.  I put the stem cells from all the fetuses I had next to a Shakey's, and they ARE replicating a new Shakey's! It worked! Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's! Huho! We sure are. Hello, is this City Wok? Uh, yes, we'd like one order of the City Beef. Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny. That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is sooo cool. Eh, AIDS? Ohmigod!  You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now. Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise. That's right Stan.  It's a cash cow I tell you. Lose weight and make money. I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done. Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt? I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid! That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off. Oh come on! Just think about how famous you'll be! He used to be fat but not no more and a lifetime of free food at City Wok. Uuh, school project. Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny! So how long until we can joke about it? Woogh, that's a long time to wait. Then eat your puke. Oh come on! Japanese girls do it. Get a hold of yourself, man! Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime. The fat one! Just like Jared. Sir, we are in business! Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again!  You are such a flabby hunk of crap!! Look at those jelly rolls!! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah!! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!! Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here. ROW you fat bitch!! Look at those jelly rolls!! Nobody loves you!! You're not even a person!! Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business. Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several. I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars. Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent pernegation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea. Well we're supposed to shoot yoru commercial today, you fat piece of crap! No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!! Check. That should blah  ah here. Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man! Alrighty. Alright, I think it's in. Bohogh, egh. There it goes. Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes. Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good. Oh, whoa. Whoa! Oh, crap! Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are! Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was?  God.  He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever. Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you. Well you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't halp his friends make money. Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine! Eh.  Eh. Yeah.  Well hello? Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. uhwatchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it. Well my hot spicy boner, of course, Dad. Well ah, loosen up, you vaginal belch. Bring it on, queer bait.  Aaaahhhh, yes! Hello? Yeah, well, Dad's being a little pussy, Mom. Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for sure. Oh, I'll be waiting with horse bells on, you old... horse-bangin' skank. Hah. There you are, Butters! No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time! No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone. Here you go.  I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat. Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back. Butters, it was my pleasure. Look you guys, Butters is asleep. Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick? When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water,  and you put their hand in it... And then, you pee on it!  heheh, heheheheheheheh. Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is sooo funny! So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler. You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone? Shh-shh, here he comes. Nothing, Butters. Right, guys?? I don't smell anythng. Do you guys? Yeah, well, that why they call is Asspen. His name is Thumper? Ugh, no more. Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body. That's awesome, Kenny. Aww, sick dude! Oh YES!! Shhh. Be quite, you guys!  Hello, is this Maury Povish?  Oh, well who the hell are you?  Oh. Well I'm calling about your ad for freaks?  Ye-right, people with disabilities?  Yeah, I have a friend; he has a deformity; I think he'd be perfect for your show.  Great! Hih-his condition?  Uh, he has a condition called ""chinballalitis.""  Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin. Shut uh- shut up you guys.  Yes.  Yes, of course he's very upset about it. Yes, he cries all the time.  Miserable, uh huh.  You wha- Really? Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow! Uh yes, I'm sure I can convince him to come on the show.  There will of course be a prize involved?  Great.

They're always making crasy masks and special effects for their dumb movies. Yeah. Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. He'd put balls on his chin. He was such an awesome friend. Yeah. Nice. They look great on you, Butters. They really do. Yeah, it sucked Hairy Butters' chin balls. Okay, here's your ticket  and they're gonna have a car waiting for you at the gate in New York. God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys? Buh-ters! Buh-ters! Testicles and scrotum! Uh oh, we're losin' him. Oh, that was close. The present. Did he say ""the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world""? Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole! Hello, is this the Maury Povich show?

So you me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset! Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass. Just give it a little kiss and I'll help. Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss.  Kiss it. Kiss it. Come on.  Kiss it. No, it has to be Kyle. Oh man, that was soho awesome! Hell, I'm not goin' with you! Heeeey! Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof. You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset. Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off. O! At least I have as ass, Jew! See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks. I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood. Eh! Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling. Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer. I want out. Yeah! Wait-what? Oh, God-damnit you guys. We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?! Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again. Can't go on. Need... food... There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf. All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters. Food! Look you guys! Beef jerky! Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy. Go ahead, that's more for us.  You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry?  Who's the hungry man? Hippies! What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies! Dah, give me that!  Talk to me Mike. Sure, sure. What do you have in mind? Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike. All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... - We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye. Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work. Hello. All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf. Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?! We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here! Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else! Mike, speak. We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us? Good, good. Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike. And Worf? Step back! Tell those men to step back! Aw, shut up, you freakin' hippies! Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, amd you must refer to me as ""Captain."" No. See, must say, ""Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?"" You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves. ""Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!"" Okay, all set! Step on it, Mr. Worf! Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf! ""Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?"" Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers. Oh, it's a double-cross!! What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf! Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are! Thank God we stopped it in time. All right! Shelley, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are? I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd! Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name? Stan, okay. What's your name? Kyle. What's your name? Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break. Amen. What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated. Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose. Dude, do you wanna the Terranace & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that? Okay, how about ... that? It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole! I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV. Wait! Wait you guys! You guys! You guys, wait! You guys, wait! Huh. Ohmigod! Huh. God, when is this gonna get to the comeercial? Argh! We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated. Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih! There, you got it, you got it! Oh, thank God. We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer about the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that'ssupposed to play during the commercials. Thsi TV is great, Chef. You guys! Aagh! God-damnit! This is killing me. The human body was not meant to move quickly like that. Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar. Oh, you've gotta be kidding' me! Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it! Here we go! That's it? That's all the commercials? Sh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now! Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people! Eewww! God, I hate old people! And my house is being fumigated! Hey you guys! Eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus help me!  Oh! I forgot the doughnuts! Oooh! Oh oh!  Oh my God!  Leave those doughnuts at home! Oh, God-damnit you better be kidding! The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on! These commercials are all so God-damned stupid! You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest. Woohoo!!! Clyde, Clyde? Did you see that?  Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too. You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over to have a see. Yeah, it sure does! I'll do it. Butters, could you take a seat, please? Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation. Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and ""filled the gap."" Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out. I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo... Lane, yes. Yes, well, we weren't. But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by.  You know the way out, right? Who cares? All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout. Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions? Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee. I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy. ...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop. We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line.  That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and... Oh, really?  That's gonna cost some points. All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten.  If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out.  Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay? Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to? All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out! Next? Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody. Alrighty then. Uh, what's the question again? Five times one is of course... Five. Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew! Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much. All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle? Just one mroe rose, Kyle. All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out! Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, ""get the fudge out!"" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde! The swinsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the candidates. Next please. If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained? Very nice. You don't drink tea in a ballpark, you French piece of crap! All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next! Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron? I think Towelie is awesome. Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered. Token's a smartass. Yeah. Do we really need another one? Oh, thanks Jimmy Alright Jimmy, see ya. Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend. Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to? You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all! No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room! Look!  Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff. Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish. Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on.  Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tonorrow! Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow... Yesss... Yeesss...  CARTMAN Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people. Only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies. Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says  ""Step 2.  Add the Sea People eggs to the water; you will see sea life spring instantly.""  Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready? Hold the sign up, Kyle!  Higher, Kyle! Okay.  Here we go. What the fuck is this?! I got RIPPED OFF! Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!!  And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!!  They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep Who cares?! Throw 'em away!! Heheh, okay, okay. Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence! Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up! Tweek! Where are you going? In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one. We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves. Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime. Ugh.  Just remember the song ""Can't Touch This"" and you'll remember the code word! Is it her? Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach!  Oh, God! You guys are such pussies!  Hemmm... No, just a bunch of goo. There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know.  The blood is washed neatly from our hands. It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach.and we put them back in their aquarium! Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too. G'night, guys. Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal. H'you guys! Come quick!  You won't believe it! Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK! I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics.  Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety. That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can really see them flourish. Tweek! You go and send away for mre sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to them all in. Me?  I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men. Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men? Do you have them or not? What's your name? Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound? I see, very interesting. Takin' a look here.  Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five. No, gallons. Damint! Give me all you've got, then! That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek? And I've got the sea men. Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley. Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh.  There we go. Nothin' to do now but wait. Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah. Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years.  Look! There's a library! A-and a temple! And a- woh-?  Oh. They think I'm God.  Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?!  I am god of the sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!! Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people! Ha ha! Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god. Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea. I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever. What the hell is wrong with you, Butters? ...So? Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares? Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room. That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people! Yeah! Go! I don't know. Ih... in our... butt? Maybe... No. Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing? Hm. Aw, dude, I think I might have it. It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out yoru butt, right? Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out yoru butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth.  Hm? What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius. Have you ever tried it? I bet you twenty buck it'll work! Okay, let's go, Jew! Hold on!  God, let a man crap! I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute! I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around. Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?!  Ugh, goddamnit you guys, this si so seriously. Yes!! Yes, I DID IT!! I crapped out my mouth!  I crapped out my mo-outh! You owe me twenty bucks, dickface! Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice. It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!  I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- You guys! You guys! Look! I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills. So? So now I can do this!  Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money! Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm. Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go. That's stupid and immature, Cartman! You guys, you guys!  I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters! So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long! Yeessss. Kyle's monneey. O-hoo, what's that, Kyle? Heh...  what? You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I hate you!! Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing. Yeah, we want our money back! You asshole! Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit. Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player! Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU! Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up! Look at it, dude. You're not offereing any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here. Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up. Well we can just make them out of paper. It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?! Tweek!  TWEEK!!  TWEEK!! How many hats have you made? We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow! Get the lead out! Then I'mo kick your ass, Tweek! I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat. Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them. But just remember that I do all the talking. Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it. Just now -  1 2 3 dibs! What could possibly go wrong? ...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek. Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Yeah, we're children. Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted. Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence? Thank you.  Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative. He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense? Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well. People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off? Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! Alriiight! Get it, Tweek! Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it! Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B. You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen? Hit it, Tweek!  In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there's a lots of- ...No, he has an icy heart. It's a cool island song. Oh, do we wanna do that? Wow. AY! Man, that new version must have sucked balls. That and youth. Those guys are old. Hello, Precious. Yes, that's a good Precious.  Now it takes the lotion from the basket. It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again. Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket. It puts the lotion back in the basket! Put the lotion in the fuckin' basket! Yes Mom? ...No, our teacher's dead. Remember? Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up. But I wanna plaaayyy. Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home? Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears? It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt. Yeah, may be. Right, heh. Woohoo. God, you know what, that's so true? Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone. Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert! Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is the like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met. And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process. And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend. Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you. And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you, and some peanuts. And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip. Pleeeeease??? Alright, fine! Well then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. But we want you to know that its been really fun. Here's a watch, and some peanuts. Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!? That's fine! That's fine!! Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan!  Fuck you, Tweek!  Bebe, you're still cool. And this is Precious. Bark bark bark.  Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket  and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants. Now you say, ""It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again."" Heheh, yeah. Now say it again, louder. Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket! Now, just yell ""Put the lotion in the fucking basket!"" Put the lotion in the fucking basket! Oh no! Precious!  I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it!  Now you say, ""Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!"" You bitch, I'll cut your throat if- We're playing ""Lambs."" Bebe's boobs? So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was? One please. Dude, relax. Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him? So weak. So weak, dude. Man. At least I'm not a stupid Jew. Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah. You bet your fat clown ass it is! ...ticket stub? Wu-we don't ""really"" need the ticket stub, do we? GODDAMNIT!!! You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember. Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle. Kenny!!! Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-! What the fuck is closure?! You turned him into a teapot? Wewewewewewe... Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards. Wewewewewewe... ...Kenny?  Kenny?! What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?! God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix! Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?! Hmmm.  Hmm, not bad. Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach. What what?  Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning! How? I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car. ...No.  Ey! Euuugh. Wha-uh, what?? What? I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off. Do you think? Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle. Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet! Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough. Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them. You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O. Because Jews don't believe in heaven! Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it. AH! In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He was born where hungry children cry, kickin', his whole family resides in the ghetto, in the ghetto What did you say?! What did you say?! I said ""Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!""  Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina? I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes. You're a- stupid Jew. Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter. Shut up! Shut up! That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me. I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body. Looks like I've come to the right place. Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that needs to be sucked out, please. Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium! Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me!  I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out! Ey! Kenny! Kenny! Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle. You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts! The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere! Don't you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my God!  You guys! YOU GUYS!! You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere. I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box.  I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken-  AY! Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW! Not by giving me brain damage! Alright, go ahead.  AY!... no.  AY!... ...I've never heard the words ""only"" and ""candy"" in the same sentence before. No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick!  ...Oh Jesus Christ. Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God! Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now! It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way. Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire. And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew. Jews can't be Paladins. Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense? Man, that's crap. And so the party returns home after completing their great quest. Prepare for battle! This sounds like a really important quest. This... is so cool. Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan's's house! And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan's's house. Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen. You're gay! Yeah! The one tape must be returned!  Run! I must say I agree. If this copy of the Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands. Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon. Open.  Bellog. We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape. Thank you, High Elf of Paragon. Clyde's a dick. Kevin, God-damnit! Talangar the Black returns from watching the video. My God, this thing must really be powerful. Quiet! You're acting like a bunch of assholes! Yeah, stupid.  Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's body is big enough for the both of us. Shut up, Kenny. A dark wizard must be trying to stop us! Guys, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure!  For that is the way of the- HA!! Fags!! It's Butters. Yes. He's been following us for like two hours. Just ignore him - maybe he'll go away. There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up! Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water! I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to WATER! Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter! We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are! That's what lost means, stupid! Kenny, shut your Goddamned mouth!! If that was possible. We're screwed. The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well. And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated. Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might by a...  Pakistani. No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny? Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny! No, it was Kenny! Ey! Aw man, this is awesome! I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again! Look, a covetous Jew! Ey! I'm not fat, I have a different life choice. Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass! I'll take three lunches today, please. Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work. Nothing. Yes sir!  Phew. Hey, I was kidding. There's actually two girls hiding down there. Hey! Kenny. Can't have Kenny. Ey Kenny! God-damn you Kenny! Hey you guys! How's it goin'? What the hell are you assholes doing here?! Oh, about a month. He's gone again. Ha-heheheh.  That was Kenny laughing, not me. Kenny! Thanks, asshole. Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass! Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ! Oh, good. Oh for the love of Christ.  I wanna watch, fat boy!  No, Kenny, it's not funny! Right now? Whoa, whoa, watch it lady. Ahh, Aahhhh! Hey, ah I feel a lot better. God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland! It's still in baggage claims! Then you throw it away, smartass. Who's this asshole? Then how does he know our names? Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag? That is so awesome!! Thank you God! Oh praise God! Juvi Hall!  Stan's a loser! Stan's a loser! Yes, come in, please. Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys. I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock? Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer? That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've beenhelping children get back at their parents ever since. Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business hre with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh? Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way. Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five.  How about five bucks? Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I thnk I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop. Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches. Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents. Now, personally, I like the baby green. But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house. Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom. Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice. Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school. The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office. Your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place. And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. What? Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches. Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday? Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it? I'm a professional, suh!  Don't worry about it, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied. Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe!  The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop! ü¾¼La caca de moreno no es aquü¾¼! ü¾¼Aquü¾¼ es verde, seü¾¼or! ü¾¼Es verde! ü¾¼Arriba arriba! Sü¾¼, gracias. ü¾¦¼Y tü¾¼?  ü¾¼Carlos! ü¾¼Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we spackle with the sponge.  See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado. Marrado. Spectacularrr. God, it's so hard to find good help. Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far? Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice. Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I?  ü¾¼Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar! Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off. Ooo, ah, that's a different company. Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ü¾¼ü¾¼Vamonos! Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become. Who the hell are you? You're done? Yeah, so how's it look? But I'll still be getting presents this year, right? What?! Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one? It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes. God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch! Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one! Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night! Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it? Jesus Christ! Hi guys!  Very Merry Christmas. God bless one, everyone! I'm just letting you know how special you are to me. You guys, that's it! Don't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunate! Follow me!  You guys, come on! Right now! ...and here's some old toys that I don't need anymore.  And here! Here's some Christmas cookies!  And some holly and mistletoe!  Oh, this'll the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too. They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to give it to them. Oh I hate this stupid Christmas poo. Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas to you! The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else. Really? Wow! Get the rest of the stuff you guys! You guys, we have to bring Christmas to those less fortunate!  Now come on! Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing! Wow, is that where Santa lives? Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then? Oh, that's so lame of them. Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well. That's what I thought. Hooray! No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He can't. Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him! Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll! It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool. Oh, Christ. Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas! Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet- Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in Santa's sleigh! I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles- I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind. Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate! It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh... Jesus! This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole! I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate people. This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys. Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me- Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means. Oh, God-damnit! Yeah, but not if you guys have one, too! Now it's worthless and gay! God-damnit I'll never try to be nice again! What? Yeah! Go home, you little dildo! Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead!  Ow! Uuugh. That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long. Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed...  in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room . Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open  and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway. Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me.  And they had big heads and big black eyes... What? No, it was just a dream,  my mom said so. What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about? Eh-ih... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me. No I don't remember that! No, because the aliens erased my memory! Aw dude, I hate repeats! SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH! What? Haha, very funny. Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing? Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Oohh. Eow. Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooo-ah. Uuuuu aaaaa. Dude. You know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump? Awesome! Aaaaaa aaaaaa ooagh! You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I""M NOT ALL RIGHT!! Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle. Nope! It has to be Kyle! Come, Kyle. Do hurry.  Go ahead, it won't bite. I couldn't resist. I'm sorry. Okay. Okay okay. Haha. Oh man, that was great. Okay, go ahead. I'm all out of farts now. Gahaaa! Derrr! Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore. Oh yes it is! Okay, okay.  Ohh, double psych! All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle. No, go ahead. I'm dry. But it was one of the best times I've ever had. Okay.  Ohhh! God-damnit! This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven. Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys. It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities! What are you doing, man?! When do we get to eat. I'm hungry. Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass!  Oh God, help me you guys! ...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you Lord. This is like my fifth time. Aw God, that movie pissed me off. Santa! Oooo, very nice. How about a taco, that craps ice cream? Guys? Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth! Tell us about it! No. There's even World War Three to look forward to. Uuugh. That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long. What is it, Chef? We didn't go to your comedy show. Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep. Hey, wait a minute!  You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it! Can too! Oh God-damnit!! But they say I can't be in their club!! Put more clay on the balls. What a crime. You can't do that! You're an art teacher! We can't let her get away with this! I think tonight we need to do something drastic. Like find out where Mrs. Dreible lives, and go over there, and... TP her house. Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper. What's the matter, Kyle? You chicken? Ugh! Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank! Should be fine. Okay.  Here we go, pack of chewing gum. Yep. All set. Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game. Heh yeah, that that's right. No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night. It's the right address-wait! Look there! There's Mrs. Dreible! This is the place. So? Kyle, you're bein' an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah. Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch! Come on, let's go! Aw man, that was sooo awesome! Who cares?? Me??  There's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle. Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Dreible probably had it comin' to her. Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caughts, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. Damn! Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine. Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46. Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it?? Oh, for Christ's sake! Thank you, Stan.  Sh sh, here they come, here they come.  ""And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'"" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now? Touchü¾¼, Mr. Mackey, touchü¾¼. They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal. Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you! Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere? No need. I have one for you right here. Is there anything else I can get for you? You do that. Goodnight, Kyle. Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle. Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack. Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did. Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is! We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle. Why not? He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us. I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride? I just thought we should find a private place to... talk. Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat?  Okay, let's go.  So how are things, Kyle? And you feel like you have to confess. I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a Wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while. Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness. Won't be long, Kyle. I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours. They did? But can I still kill Kyyyle? Uh, can we see them-him-her? What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself! Wiffle ball, anyone?  Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball? You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now? What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime. Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever. So... so then, how can you feel bad? ...But he's not gonna get in trouble. What?? Eh...  hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free! For oth-er...  Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later? Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man! Come on, you guys! Hurry!  Guys, hurry! It's over this way! Come on! So how are things, guys? I'm afraid I can't let that happen. Can't I? Hi guys. I told them everything, you guys. It's over. My consciences just caught up with me. I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later. I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible. Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you- Hm. Mmmath homework, Mmmath homework. Where did I file that? Bush is a Naizi ...Eh the... Founding who? Ugh. UGHuh.  I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old! But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off. Maaaa. M-maaaa. Maaaa. Mah mah mh.  Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days?  In those days? In those days? In those days? I'm trying to have a flashback. You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand! Nonono. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second.  Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then?  Back then? Back then? Back then?  Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me.  With me. With... anything to do with me. With me. Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa! That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776. All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers! Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please? Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. Benjamin Franklin? Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew! Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time. Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Foundig Fathers! I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history! Or a really sweet one. Whoa, here it goes! Ohhh awesome!!! Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is? Oho yes! I did it I did it! Oho kick fucking ass, dude! No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback. Well you know, it's a...  H-ho, awesome! Super neato! But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report. Oh, okay.I guess I understand.  I don't wanna wait for our life to be over... I don't wanna wait for our life to be over... And I am the official messenger boy, I am. Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day. It's a bitch, ain't it? Wow. Whoa, how very very relevant. Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. Wow, I get it now! I get it!  Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time. Wow! Everyone, stop! Please! If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say. I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truely great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to. You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called ""having your cake and eating it too."" The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass. Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez. Miss Lopez, come on out here. Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Lations and the arts? Oh, you mean this one? There we go, Saright? That's a very pretty dress. Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez Nono, Jeh- Jeh- Jeh Jennifer Lopez Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts?

Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep. Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna be a great day. Great day tomorrow... Tomorrow...  ""Kyle, you were wrong! We did do a record deal!""

It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez. Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does. Quiet, Ms. Lopez. Guys... Uh... Uh... I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here? Hahahahahaaaha!  I got you kinda! I got you kinda! Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar. Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve? My God... What have you got, Marsh? Jesus, we're too late. Slowly the rage built inside his mind. ""Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!"" His only solution became obvious: Kill her! Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. The torso he would dump into the lake. And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie. Looks like the game is over, old man! Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all.  And get some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass! Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll. No sign of forced entry. We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room. Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over! Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat. Right. I think I know exactly where to start. Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?! Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth! You're going down, Butters! You hear me?! You're worth a two-dollar criminal and you're lying! Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample. You just make the semen come out of your body and fill it in this cup! Stop playing games! That does it! Wait right here!  Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make seme come out of your body. I don't know. I was hoping you guys did. Really? Oh okay.  Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?! Follow me to the bathroom. Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your weiner until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup. Yes, retard. Semen comes from your weiner. Now do it!  Well Butters?! Well pull harder! Try doin' it faster Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?! The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes! Let's go! Kyle! I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew! Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them. Why not? Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got! Yeah! This was our hot lead! Damnit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off! All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo!  Wwwaaahhh! We got her back safe. We lost a lot of good men in the process. Kewl! Uh bonus? Me neither. Hey! Broflovski's a good cop! Awwwwrrr-auugh. We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista. Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?! Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired. Okay. Butters? Are you still trying to give a semen sample? Well, keep tryin', Butters. A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods? Un oh... Bang bang bang... Kenny, it doesn't go ""Pakew! Pakew!"", it goes ""BANG BANG BANG!!"" Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five.  On your American Express. Man, Indians have it good, huh? All right, let's go! I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?! Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude. Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians! That's right! Wait a minute! I've got it, you guys! We can get Kyle infected with AIDS! And then start a charity organization that we steal money from! Come on, let's go!  No? We can't give Kyle AIDS? Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now. Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts! You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies! What? Tell us? Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever! What a dork! Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th. We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys. That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us. Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you! Oh yeah?! We're all just super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay! GOD I HATE CRAIG!!  That son of a... djah!! You're straight like a freedway! You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!! ...So? I'm half bisexual! I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi. Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp. Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that- Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle. We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle. Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy. He's not our friend. Yeah, and let's see Craig outgay us now. That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade. Heheheheheh heheheheheh. Inspiration. Wait a minute,  that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see? Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christiand will buy our crap! It worked for Creed! You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genious! Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do! Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle!  Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house! Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. I told you, Token. Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially-windfalling experiences of our young lives. We are going to start... a Christian rock band. Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- Still want to leave, Token?  Thank you. All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  See? All we have to do is cross out words like ""baby"" and ""Darling"" and replace them with Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line. Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass. Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line! All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. Almost there, you guys. Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover. I'm going to kill you one day, Token. Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. No no no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool! Token, look away to the right.  More. More! So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it! Our first album cover. Oh hey guys. How's it going? I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band, Faith + 1, is about to go platinum. That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya!  Hahahaha ha ha! It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walkng, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album. I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Tata! Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's evern been produced, actually.. I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ. Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off. Damnit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage! Who are you? Yeah, you guys are real hard core. Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage. Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better.  Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we... You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song. Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent. Yes, we sure do. Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ?? Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this?? I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now. Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone. Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday. I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face! The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned! Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly. Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense. We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.  There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone! Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you! Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on.  Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now. Ahhh, this is the best day of my life. Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album? You mean to tell me I could never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?! GOD DAMNIT!! Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums! OH, FUCK JESUS!! Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus! Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring. Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and paases the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again , proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey! I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body. Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again. Calm down! We cannot understand you! Old people! Oh God, they're coming! They're not gonna stop until we're all dead! Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong? My God, he's right.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death.  Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys.  Except for you, Kyle. I believe that's us... thank God. More old people! Old people gone mad! So our only solution is to cut off their life force. No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here. Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do. Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week. I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.  We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our triple goodbye to Kyle, and them we send him inside. Yeah! Aw yeah! Well, right, or we could always do that. Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome. Who's joking? You have AIDS? Wow! Casa Bonita?! Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff! This Saturday! Awesone!  Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere.  Casa Bonita! You... your Mom said you could take three friends. Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny? Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butthole?! Why?! I have never been a dick to you. Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew? Okay, except maybe for that one time. Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place  in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please! Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!  Kiss my ball, asshole!! Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle. Ah I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we we've moved past it. Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die! Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!  Oh, awesome!!  Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave!  Wow, cliff divers!  More sopapillas, please! No! Noooo!  Casa Bonita! Noooo!  AAAAH!! Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle! Hi Kyle. What isn't it? ...I don't understand the difference. Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something. Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how ""do"" you act nice to people? Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people? Like what? Who's there? Take that, Jimmy!  And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again! Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?!  Oh, Kyle. Hey. Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock knock, Kyle! Hey Kyle. Well what? I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go. So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool. I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later. I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore. Good. Sweet, whatever.  Bingo! Butters, can you keep a secret? For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible. A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth. Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think. Do you see anything? Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust. Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer? Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth. I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus. According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours. No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter! Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his back yard! Come on, Butters! Hurry! Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here! All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks. No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others. I'm not sure of anythng anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth. Well, you know, with your wiener.  Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present. Hope you have a good one. See you later. Yes? Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything? Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure. Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters. Well, let's get going, shall we? Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters... Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then. Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?! Butters! Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible! The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time... There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiatino level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh... We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday.  G-goodbye!  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight. Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita. What what what? UUuuugh!! Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We'be gotta get out of here! They're coming this way! The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals! They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive. We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins. Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location.  There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top.  Good. Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town. All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice. Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble. We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter. Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God! It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal! We've got to fight them off!  Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope! Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!! Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack? Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!  Die! The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me,  which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well. We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you! Look! There's an old refrigerator! Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you! Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter. I love you too, man. I just  You look so delicious! Must eat your brains! Hah!  It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday! Only three more days till Casa Bonita. I'm gonna go through Black Bart's Cave first. No! I'm gonna watch the cliff divers first! Maybe if I tell them it's my birthday, they'll let me cliff-dive in the pool!  Oh, that would be so bad-ass! We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail. ""Pretty cool."" So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show. What? Fuck Kyle.  Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle. Happy Birthday to you. Happy- We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita! Aw man, this is gonna be so great! But... Casa Bonita. But I...  but...  Stand back! I... am going... to Casa... Bonita! \ Ah! Eh.

Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now. Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together? Oh my God... Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter. Eeheehee, Jesus Christ. Oh no! You guys broke up? Uh oh, the jilted lover returns. I'm going to kill myself You guys, Kenny's eating his own hands. Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey. Nothing. Nothin' Na- Due-nothing. Gross dude! No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes. We're sorry. Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me? Yeah, huh?  Ih, it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah! Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us. Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you? Got it! Isn't he awesome, you guys? Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol. Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir. Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today. Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome. Oh my God, that is what I've always said.  I love this guy! God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps? So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on! Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle? Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, ""How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?"" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't  gonna  work on  me  ha  ha  ha . Only one of us can be in the commecial, gentlemen. The game... is on. Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the comemrcial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now.  Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha- Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.Wait, this isn't my house. Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha! Heh, ho-okay. Heh, okay, okay.  You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead.  Dead?? Uh what... what does that mean, ""I'll be dead""? Hey, uh what, what was that ""dead"" part? Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry. I'm not eating the cupcake. Jesus Christ! HAAAA! They're going to kill me! The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!! You guys have to help me! Please, you guys, I don't know what to do! If I go, you guys go! Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us! Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong! You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heah! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company. I don't idolize you anymore, asshole! Right. What are we playing again? Got it. What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank! Yeh-heah, right! What a whore! Come on, Stan, it's first down still. God, what a fag! How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet. Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade. Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas. We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas! Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmastime. I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all. Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you. HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas! What? No! No, this can't be happening! You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!! Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!!  You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!!  AAAAAA!! It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?! This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now. You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents? Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all. We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas.  That means we have to be back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark. Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing! You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort. Of course I care about Christmas- Doh, Christ on a stick! Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here! Sweet. Oh Jesus Christ. Which road?! Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry. But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister. Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time! How much further to Ottawa! Christmas is only twelve hours away. How could you be so stupid! Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down!  Well it's on! We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW! We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead. Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost Christmas! And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents. I'm gonna kill you, Kyle. It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada. Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents!  And what did I tell you, Kyle?!  I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?! Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now! We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come on! Come on!!  Mooooooom! Moooooooom! Pfaha, so funny. Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody. Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?! I'm gonna get those killer sai.  Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken  for a dollar ninety nine. Parents? Parents??  Oh God! Why?!  Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why!  Why?! Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you! Iya! Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies Kick ass! Hey you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous. Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine! Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are a sloth and you are a liar. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true. Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig. Look what we got. Oooh, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy. Ugh. Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril.  Come on, ninjas! Ho man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome! We're playing Ninjas, Butters. No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us. Yes, and no time to do it. No time... Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it. I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers. I have the power to have all the powers I want. C'mon! Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys. That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass! All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain! All right! And now I will use my power to...  turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh! Hahahahahaaa ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya! Oh, fuck dude! Guys, meeting over here for a second? All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard. Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us. Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle.  Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character. Shut up, Butters.  Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning. Dr. Shafley? So if we make Butters up to look like a dog,... I need the modeling glue. We need more fur over here. Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole! Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters. Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen!! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot. In here! No way, you got weapons too?? Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame! We're twice the ninjas you fags are! Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!!! Butters! Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here right now! We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you, and that's the ninja code! Here, Butters! Butter-Butters! Here, Butters! Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things! Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchakus away. If you can. But you know well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try. Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screamig ""NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!"" You know this to be true.  Go ahead. Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle.  Do it! All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by. I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold.  This way, I can move about the crowd of people undetected. Here, hold this stuff for me. What? I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction! Hey, fuck you, Kyle! The Special Olympics? What's so special about them? Dude, what? Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement. What? What did I do? YOU GUYS! YOU GUYS! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich! Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: ""At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000"" So?? So dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks! It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicappeds! Terrible?? Whatever! You guys's brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see. Why? What are you gonna do, Kyle? Tell on me?  Then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale! Is that really how you deal with your problems?! Grow up, Kyle!  All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is. Darrrr. Durrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics.  Bull's eye! Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey.  Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrrt. You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away.  I'm going to go sign up now. What?? Moooommmmm? Um, could I get you to do something for me? Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollare? I'm not special? I thoght you always said I was special. ...I'll split the money with you. All right, Mom, look. Here's ...the truth.  God, this is gonna be hard to say.  I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes, ...if I could just see the challenges they face every day, ...mauye I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change.  Help me change? Awesome. Naaaa! Daaaaa! Naaaa! Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa! ...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa!  CARTMAN Go on, Kyle. Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion but- Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul. Yes.  And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle.  Good luck. One thousand dollars, yeah! Daaaa! Daaaa! Whoa. What the hell?? Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events. God-damnit!! All right, this one I can win!  Here, hold this!  I'll show you Goddamned retards! God-damnit!! Ah, screw you hippie! ...I could pile at Shakey's, heck. Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr! Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh. Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine. What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew? All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew? All right, hang on. We're about to land. Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here. It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle! Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible. Set phasers on stun. Yes. A little too quiet. Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out!! It's a giant four-headed lava frog!! Shoot it!!  Oh no, it got Kyle!! Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!!  Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for. Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along! Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil! How do you know?! I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it. Go see the movie, Kyle!! You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you. Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson. Sweeet, now I can just play with myself. Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft! Mom! Doorbell! Mom! Answer the door! Goddamnit, lazy-ass whore. It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again? Mmm, one more time, Kyle. I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done.  Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen. Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club. Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m. What? You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes. If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick. Ohoh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall! Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open! I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch! Eup. Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did. Tell them I'll be down shortly Tü¾¦¼ten sie die Juden. Wir kü¾¦¼nnen nicht stillstehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson. Ah hello everyone. Achtung.  My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.  Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done. But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps. Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we  all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion. Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean. One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gathere here as a people brought together by its message!  Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world!  Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie! And as we march for The Pasion we should also voice our support! So, when I say ""Es ist Zeit fü¾¶¼r sauberen,"" you all chant back ""Wir mü¾¶¼ssen die Juden ausrotten."" Wir mü¾¶¼ssen die Juden ausrotten!! Es ist Zeit fü¾¶¼r Rache! All right, everyone! Forward, march! Es ist Zeit fü¾¶¼r Rache! Es ist Zeit fü¾¶¼r Rache! Nice. Es ist Zeit fü¾¶¼r Rache! Es ist Zeit fü¾¶¼r Rache! Es ist Zeit fü¾¶¼r Rache! Juden! Mel! Gibson!  Oh mein Savior! Mein Fü¾¶¼hrer! You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding!  Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?! HA! You just got f'd in the a! Yeah! All right!

Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears? I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video? What? Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function. ...No way. Weak! Lame! AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading. Where is it? Where is it?? Wah! Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you. AWESOM-O understands. Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape! I would like some Sunny Delight too. AWESOM-O will answers the door. Shh!

We could meet up later, perhaps? The New Orleans Saints. Seventeen. Um... okay. How about this:  Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a ...golden retriever, or something. Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a ...boxer, or something. You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas. Haaaa! Haaaa! AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint. Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut. ...What? AWESOM-O does not understand. LAME! NOT COOL! TOTALLY LAME! Waaaaa! Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?! The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?! I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive! I said I'm a real person, asswipe!

Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now. Huh look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on, guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels. Oh my God, this is awesome! Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest dad in the world! Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?! They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket, and he has the coolest dad in the world! They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?? Guess. A train. Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come! Choo-choo train! Yay! Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson. Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you. ... Train together ... I've got time. Do youuu?? Choo-choo train. Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight! You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want! Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it! Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me GOD, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?! You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away! He is MY friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were, and I hoowi-  Stan! Stan, I'm serisouslih! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson! Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend! Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. Deeper.  Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat hairy balls! Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember? Mr. Jefferson, hello?? No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson!  All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery! Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child. Hel-lo ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars? Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am! It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!  Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool. No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak.  What? Dude, I'm takin' a break. Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers. It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks? Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass! Shoveling accident. You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I'd totally let you have it. What?? Who?? We can't understand you, asshole! Look, it's working! Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other. Goddamnit PETAns piss me off! We're never gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot. Ye-heah! Yeh- no, no, wait wait wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in ""Turd Sandwich."" Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be soo funny! IT IS NOT!!! Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week. ...Wait wait, what about Butters? Goddamnit you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich? It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it. A turd sandwich. Turd sandwich. Turd sandwich. AWWWW!! Okay. You win, Kyle. All right turd sandwich! Giant Douche sucks! Dream on, Jew boy! Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives. Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for Tomorrow! Hello, Clyde. We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot. Oh really? Well that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision.  Butterscotch candy? Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school? You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the coin. And the lettuce, and the olives. So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes? Well then, perhaps we could interest you in  another butterscotch candy? Hey, fuck off, Kyle.  Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a niiice steak dinner with all the trimmings. Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! It's an obvious suck-up move. Oh no! NOOO!! Yeah, when you die, your jowels release and crap comes flying out your ass. Oh yeah?! I'll bet you five bucks that when you die you crap your pants, asshole! Whoa, awesome! Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks! Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks! Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight! Dude, you can't shop for crap. Excuse me! Hello! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall*Mart has them for three bucks cheaper? What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle. That's called progress, Kyle. ... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall*Mart. It was only five bucks. Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle! You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you? No, but YOU got everyone all worked up! You're jealous of the Wall*Mart. You always hated it. Oh, awesome! Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine cents? Wall*Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you again?  Yes, Wall*Mart. I understand. Wait guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out. Nuh uh. I AM NOT, Kyle! Haha. You fools have no idea that I wuold never let you hurt the Wall*Mart. You heard what? That's not what I said! Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea that I'm actually working for the Wall*Mart to stup you from succeeding! I did not! I wanna close Wall*Mart just as much as you guys do! Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much? You speak too much, sir! That's ten bucks you owe me, dickface! I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall*Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall*Mart all along! No you didn't. No you didn't. No you didn't. No you didn't. No you didn't. ... You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu- I can't hear you! Lalalalalala!  I'm sorry, boys. but if you want to hurt the Wall*Mart, you'll have to go through me! Very well, Kenny! Let us battle!  No, Kenny. Kenny! Knock it off. Hey gaybots, what's goin' on? Really? That's cool. When did-?  What did you say?  Trent Boyett? Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at US Trent Boyett?? Oh, Holy Jesus, God is... It's true. He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men. Jews can't be firemen. Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew! But how do we start a fire? Don't worry, Trent. Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing! Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did. Trent Boyett is a liar, sir. Whatever. That's like five years from now. Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents! You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart! We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters! Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister! How the hell are condoms gonna help us?!  Sorry, heh. Never mind, heh. A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots & Ladders game used only three times, DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase of any deloxe hamburger at Red Robin. All this can be yours. Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool. I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange.  You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts. Nononono, you gotta go  ""But Mo-o-o-om."" ""But Mo-o-o-om."" Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my asscheecks. Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now. Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff! All right! You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world! Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass. Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a-  Hwuh?! He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls. A picture of your mom's boobs? A lot of stupid things that we regret. AAAAAAAAH! Yes, our conscious got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth. Stay away from us, Trent! It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse.  Just back off, man! I am NOT going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters! Trent Boyett is a liar, sir. Whatever, that's like five years from now. We did it!  So long, Trent! Have a nice time!  Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!  Hahahahahaaahaaa! Uh oh. And I'm Rick Cartman. Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh. ...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities? All right, Butters, keep your eyes open. Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right. Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip. All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice. How many students is that? What is that butthole doing now?! Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Withot it, we have nothing. ...You're gay!! Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood. God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park! Go play with yourself, Craig. Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?? You're helping Craig make his show?! I can't believe you would betray us like that?! We've always been supercool to you!  Ah whatever, Kenny! It should be Sexy News. Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting. Gosh, Butters, write that down! And panda bears for the preschoolers. We're in fourth grade, Timmy. We don't even know what ethical means. Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Token, I, I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona. You see Token, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... Seeing African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha, how should I say... white.  Token, all the great African-Americans newspeople have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings. Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls! And now, for a look at the weather, here is Token Black, and Token, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way. Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the jinx on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle? One testicle!  What an asshole! Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let's get a look at the celebrity scene shot, with Butters. All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we're goin' to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle. Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who's got Skidmark Monday. It's boring news, Jimmy. All right, tell me about it. Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about? Oh man, this is sooo great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you! I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade! How about we have us, um... hmmm. Wait, I've got it.  Crab people. They're like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground. Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies! How about we do a show where we kill Butters? We have crab people. Just sayin'. That sounds perfect. Huh. I don't have any ideas yet. Stan, are you getting good ideas? Stan? Stan, come on. We're gonna go find a frog. Oh Stan, I just got the best idea Dude, this TV show is awesome. Ah I did. I wrote something down.  Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle. They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remiedy. But behind closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Hoochie, wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of cough medicine abuse. And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch. Haha! In your face, Craig! ""Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure.""  Fuck you Millie, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch! Oh, hey, What's goin' on? I'm uh, here for the party. Oh uh uh Kelly. Kelly invited me. Kelly Rutherford Menskin. Oh wait wait wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkerton Tinfurter Oh Goddamnit! This is gonna be totally cool, you guys. ...Geez, this looks a lot higher from up here. I'm gonna. Okay, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight! Eugh... Wheh? Where am I? Coma... How long? Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients? This is bullcrap! Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours! Probably in your front pocket, dumbass! Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch. I don't know, I just knew it.  Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?! How come the outline is missing its hand? Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles...  Double-Stuff Oreos... He ... He's taking the top of one and... ...and he puts it together to make Quadruple-Stuffs!  I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs! Guess again. Wow! I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers. You don't. Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks! Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes? Do not doubt my powers, Kyle! Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thoght! Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at! What? I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go! No. Nothing. Wait a minute.  Fried chicken. It's tender and it's fresh.  There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken. It is fried chicken!  Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae. If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands. *clap* *clap* If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands. *clap* *clap* More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring. Proper channels? I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School. Ten percent my balls, get lost! Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds! In court? Cool.  Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle!  Who are you? ... 'K. Sweet. Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second. Mom, there's some homeless guy here. Make him go away. Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?? I don't even know you dude! Oh Jesus. No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want! Heheh. Yes yes, I see! AAAAAAAH! Oh my God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me! (Hey! Come over here!) (Hey! Get me out of here!) No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested. Please just let me go! Ah I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna-  I don't wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you! You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability. I don't believe anyone interrupted YOU when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please? All right, fine! Forget it! Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends. That's not at all what happens. ""Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?"" said the little boy in the red poofball hat. This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball. Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa!  Kyle, I'm totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time. Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball! You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties. He's a Jewish dolphin. A Jewphin. Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies.  Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic? Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am. See that? Hippies. These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard. Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard. Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson county. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony. Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymerethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas.  Goddamnit! Goddamn hippie! Get out of here! Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-cricle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse! The college know-it-all hippies. All right, in you go. Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced! What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why! Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it. And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints , and a guitar! Please, I have to talk to you all right now! Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over! I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town. At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.  Then I saw this... Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They'er thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... . hippie music festival. Ti's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that last for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen. I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast! It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. What are you doing?!  You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug!  The town is in serious danger! I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to our basement! Oh Jesus, not you guys?  What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?! Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been comprimised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'll expect the same from you. Everybody get in a single-file line! Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted. What? You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them! No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay! What did I do?! They're not people, they're HIPPIES! Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert! You... You what? They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?! You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN!  That kid really needs some psychiatric help. How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it it all worth?! GODDAMNED HIPPIE! Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it. Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival. Forget it. It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now! Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer. I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot. Yes.  Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous! All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and get super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?! All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick. In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. My only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here.  If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system.  Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all. We drill.  I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. They pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside. Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientest, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong. All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.  Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the qualifications, let's see...  Oh, I know. How about- There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we-  got. I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog.  Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had. Primary engine running? Navigation systems? Let's punch this baby.  We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on.  Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status? Switching to secondary fuel line.  What's that? Come on, come on! No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there! ...All right, fine Chef, go! Hit the PA system NOW!  Put me in the main line! You're the scientist, jackass! Put them in my laptop! Hold it right there, Kyle! Of course he sings. He's black. You wanna know what it is, guys? That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side. Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star. So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Token's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes! We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all. Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there. Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk. Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit. Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested. Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?! Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night. Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you. This will only take a second. Welcome to our offices, Token. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm?  Come on over this way, Token. Guys, you remember Token. He's thinking about becoming a client. Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, ""Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?"" Right? Token, the truth is that without representation, you in danger of being taken advantage of.  Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token.  Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln?  Yeahh, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now. I'll I'll call you back, Abe. I'm making it look like important people call us. ...well Token doesn't know that. How?! Jew! Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.  Ah, now, where were we? Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here? From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token. You just do all the singing, all the performing and all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us. We represent Token.  Give us a call, we'll work out a deal. Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is... Sweet! You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency. Token, you signed with us! What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby! ...Oooo... ...Goddamnit! This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless addict from now on! You've ...already done all the work? We'll go to LA with your wife. All she has to do is go on the show, do all the performing, make all the money, and leave the rest to us. Excuse us! Dude, how long is the wait? Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That's my cell phone.  Hello? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is. Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken. Stupid assholes! Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well? Come on, Wing! She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that. Gay. Your gift of hope is a great deduction. Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer. Four thousand dollars?? That's four hundred for us! We did it! Who let the dogs out? Who let the dogs out? Who let-? Naw, sh-she was with you! Wing? Wing?? Wing? Here, Wing! Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back. Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients! Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls. Oh my God, you guys. Look!  They do have an amazing fountain. Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rouch, we can play rought too! Do you wanna play rough?! Okay!  Take this! Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it! Aw aw guys, come on! Token, you're... waiting tables? Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. today. I have to be the first to get one! Come on! Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go! I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry!  What the hell?! Kenny, when did you get here? Friday?! Aw, Jesus!  I'll just... sort of get in here- in here. Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line. Oh, Goddamnit!  They'd better not sell out! YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE! JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH! Fag! Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the man? Who cares? Kenny's dead!  When do I take possession of my PSP, sir? Yes! Well... well then he's NOT alive. That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look. Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar? Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube. Um, it was um, this one time... Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Did you all hear that??  Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this! Did so! Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew!  I'm gonna get that feeding tube removed if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court! You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right. I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF. That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look. Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is. He's right in here. That's right. Respect our authoritih-m. I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato! You say Kenny, but I say tomato! What? We're done! No more baseball! All right, we did it! Post-season? Nobody told us if we win too many games we'd go on to the finals! All right, hit one out of the park! Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it. All right! Ball. Balll. That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch! You need some Goddamned lasik surgery! What?! Aw Goddamnit! How the hell was that a strike?!  Goddamnit, he's going to first! What happens if we win the State Championship game? Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team. Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our team, who totally sucks ass. I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game! We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose! Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?! She's got Colonel! Oh boy! Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy? Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast. Well, I saved you all the chicken part. Well, I gotta go home, guys. I'm gonna sit on the toilet and read comic books. See you at the bus stop tomorrow. Hey fags, what's going on?  Dude, I was on the toilet all night from that chicken. I thought I was gonna die. Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one.  Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes? Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle?  Eh. K-Kenny, you see that chick on the news that had her left titty cut off?  Kenny? Kenny??  Stan? Stan, it's me, Eric! Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty cents?  Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm right here!  Wha...? How did...? Like they couldn't see or hear me. It's almost as if I were...  dead.  No. No, I can't be dead.  I can't be dead!! No! No!! Oh my God, this can't be happening! Mom? Mom's crying? Oh God, it is true! Oh, it's not fair!  Why??? Why??? Guys! Guys?  Can anybody hear me? You guys??  Token, Token, I'm here!  Hello! Hello! Hello!  Clyde, can't you feel me?  Feel me, Clyde!  Jimmy! Jimmy, it's me, Eric!  Jimmy!  Can't you feel your hair move?! That's me!  They don't even know yet, that one of their best friends is dead.  Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul. What did I do to deserve this?!  How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?! ...What did you say? Butters...  Butters! You can see me?? Oh my God, and you can hear me?? Because, Butters, I'm... dead. Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you! I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides. I don't know, but you're the only one who can. Butters!  Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help! Butters... Butters, you have to help me! All right, Butters, you leave me no choice. Butters. Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me! Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven. What do you mean? I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?! Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you. This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life! Tell her, tell her that I love her. Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes! It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted! Just the good times. I can't! Don't you understand?! God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me! All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black. Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's eveyone, I guess. All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you. Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now. Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!! Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on? What else do I have to do?! Atone? Not really... Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it. I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uuh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid. Really? I know how. Well, there's everything, Butters. I've made everything right. Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave.  Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye...  Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right! I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?!  Do you think this is funny,..? Butters. Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here. I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do! She's gonna close soon! Come on! I told you, Butters. Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day! All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostiages. Don't worry. I have a plan. They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead. Yes, it's working! Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day. My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends. We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you. Goodbye Buttters. I must be going now. I'll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters! Goodbyyye! You sonofabitch Butters! Hey, that's bullcrap?! How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?! No room at the inn, Virgin Mary. Up yours, Butters. Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man? Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food. Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times. I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her thnk you're a good listener. Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say. Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how good she looks. Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, ""Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."" All right, when she stops yappin' again, say ""Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right."" All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with ""Wow, how insightful."" Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice. Aaagh! D'you know what you are? You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say ""That's the bad guy!"" Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!"
"STAN","What's a dildo? What's a dildo, Kenny? Dude that kicks ass! Whoa, Cartman, looks like you didn't get much sleep last night. Dude! Visitors! That wasn't a dream, Cartman, those were visitors!

Good morning, Ms. Crabtree. Oh, don't worry about him. Yeah, whatever you fat bitch. I said I have a bad itch. Cartman, are those the same Visitors you saw?! Well, we can't do anything for now. That fat bitch won't let us. I-I said that rabbits eat lettuce. Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him- DUDE! Damn Cartman! (pointing to Cartman) It's the alien anal probe! It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!! How can you eat when you're farting fire? Where? Shut up Fat Ass! I don't even like her! I do not! Holy crap!  It says she wants to meet ME at Starks Pond after school. What? How do you know she has a cat? Ah Chef, Chef. Chef. Chef!!!!! -CHEF!! Visitors took Kyle's baby brother. Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up. Woa! Killer, thanks Chef. Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now. What the hell was that?! KYLE, LOOK! It's them! Oh my God!! They killed Kenny! Hey, look - I think Kenny's okay! Wow, poor Kenny. Cartman, they KILLED Kenny! Dude, Kenny is dead! See?! Sorry dude, I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger. Dude, like Chef says, I gotta get a piece of loving while the gettin's hot. But her note said she'd be here! Hey wait, when do I get to make sweet love? Don't be such a fraidy cat, Cartman! This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again. I think we need to signal the them somehow. Come on, Cartman! Fart! He can't hold it in forever. Hey! It's happening again! Now do you believe us Cartman?! Cartman!  There's an eighty-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass! Go on, Kyle, ask them for your little brother back... Yeah... That was beautiful, dude. Nope, they're leaving. Woa, dude. Hey Wendy, what's a (BEEEEEP) I'm sure glad that's over with. Thanks for your help, Wendy. Hey I didn't throw up! Sorry. Cool! I think its part of a Cheesy Poof. Gee, the bus'll be here any minute and Cartman still isn't around. I wonder what that thing was the visitors gave the cows? Oh, hey Cartman! Really? What about? Yeah, what's there to HATE about rainbows?! Cartman, what the HELL are you talking about?!?! What were YOU talking about?! That's impossible!! Cartman doesn't know a rain forest from a pop-tart! Dude, Dolphin's are like the second smartest animal on the planet! Yeah, 'cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest. Yeah! That'd be cool! We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy! Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly!! Dolphins are way smarter than YOU! DOLPHINS DON'T LIVE IN IGLOOS! THAT'S ESKIMOS!! Tell me what you wrote about!! Yeah right, you'll go sit in front of the T.V. and eat Cheesy Poofs, assmaster! What?! You've got to weigh ninety- pounds! Super Fat Ass? Take THAT you stupid Indian! Shut up, Cartman! Wendy, you've got to Prioritize!! What's more IMPORTANT? Being on TV, or some stupid assassination?! Wendy, look! Mr. Garrison! Stop! Man, did she really throw her voice with TWO dummies at once? What about not holding anything against the person who wins? Come on, Wendy. Kyle's mom'll make us tuna fish sandwiches. We hope you can come back to school real soon, Mr. Garrison. Yeah, my uncle Jimbo says we got to get up there early! Right, Uncle Jimbo? Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too Cartman. Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer. You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman! Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says. My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa! Hey! It wasn't coming right for us! It was just sitting there! Wow, you're smart, Uncle Jimbo! Is this hunting? I can't... I don't wanna shoot the bunny. I'm not hysterical. I just don't want to shoot the bunny. I can shoot you fat ass! I'll kill you! No, no thanks, that stuff tastes like pee. Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too. Whattlebutt? Why? A hook! Celery?! Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories! (Laughing) Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets! (Groggily) What, dude? Well, where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned? (Hurt) With Kenny? But, but this was supposed to MY camping trip... Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore? What? Uncle Jimbo! Cartman's missing! Yeah. Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg? No, I can do it, Uncle Jimbo. I wanna bag that animal! I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt, then we'll see who's a little bastard! AW, DAMMIT! I CAN'T DO IT! Cartman? WOA!! I did it! I did it! I finally killed something! Hey! That was EASY! What? Why? No. But I just wanted you to be proud of me like you were with Kenny. That's my new dog, Sparky. (Proudly) He followed me to the busstop! Good boy, Sparky! Who's my best buddy? Who's your boy? Who's your buddy? He's part Doberman, and part wolf! He's the toughest dog on the mountain! He's not meaner than Sparky! Sparky'll kick his ass! That's it, Sparky kick his ass! Sparky?! Bad dog. WHAT? What do you mean? (To the boys) He's just confused. Sick, shut up, dude! HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT! Huh? Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see? He IS smart! Yeah, but MY dog found his own way here! That makes him smarter than your -- SPARKY get down!! GET DOWN SPARKY! DOWN! Umm... I'm not really prepared either. Okay... Uh... Asian culture has... plagued our fragile Earth for many years. We must end it -- Wow, cool! Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question? What's a... homosexual? I guess. Shut up, dude! Sparky! Where'd you get that pink scarf?! He just needs some training, that's all... Sit Sparky! Good boy... Now, Shake... Good boy... Now, DON'T BE GAY. DON'T BE GAY, Spark. DON'T BE GAY. I dunno. Come on you guys, I have an idea! Okay, Sparky, we got you a present. Now, why don't.... Dammit Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?! NO PINK BANDANA, SPARKY! BAD DOG!! Now pay attention, Sparky... This is Fifi. Atta boy, Spark! Get her! YES!! AW CRAP!! Now what do I do?! I know, Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil... But, but Sparky doesn't seem evil. Like who? Uh, hi, Jesus? I have a dog... And he's... Uh... He's a homosexual. DAMMIT! I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews! ISN'T THERE ANYBODY WHO CAN HELP ME?!?! ISN'T THERE ANYBODY WHO CARES?! NO IT'S NOT OKAY!! I DON'T WANT A GAY DOG!!! I WANT A BUTCH DOG!! I WANT A RIN TIN TIN!! I just can't concentrate, 'cause my dog is gay. I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice. Have you guys seen Sparky? He still hasn't come back. I think he might have run away. I'm not playing. I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. Sparky! Where are you??!! Where could he be?! Sparky?! SPAAAARKY?! Fine, how are you? My gay dog ran away and I was wondering if maybe he came here. Do you have lots of gay dogs here? Wow, it seems like the animals here are really happy. SPARKY!! Hiya Sparky, how's it going? I missed you, old pal, you really had me scared. Come on, let's go home, I can still make it in time for the game. We can work on making you not gay together. Sparky? What don't I understand? This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you, Spark. I just didn't understand. Thanks for everything Big Gay Al! No thanks, I've gota get back for the big football game. Come on boy! I will Big Gay Al, I will. I've been getting my best friend back. HIKE! Uh... It... It's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys. And... And maybe we can beat 'em even more next year! And it's okay to be gay! Being gay is just a part of nature, and a beautiful thing! I was with my new friend Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary and took me on a Big Gay Boat ride where I learned all about the wonders of gayety. It's true, I'll show you. But it was here... It was all right here. There was a techno dance club... Oh, there you are, dude. How's it going? Wow... NO! She's just pissed off 'cause she got head gear at the dentist. She's taking it out on me. My parents don't even believe that she beats me up. They think she's all innocent and sweet. But I know that she's an evil bitch. Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing? Yeah. Wow, that's cool! That'd be cool! Wait, wait, we still need a pig. Okay... (hanging his head) Yes. Oh, neither, it's my sister. Hi Shelley. Head gear? What head gear? Oh, gosh. I didn't really notice. No! I think it looks terrific! It matches your -- Go where? Yeah, quit being such a baby. Least I'm not a little pig-#$%@er! Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses? -- Ow! Yeah, what kind of name is Pip, anyway? Yeah, go away Pip. Hey, Chef. I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig. Well how do we do that? Hey, uh you guys wanna come over to my house? Really? You guys don't want to come over just for a little bit? Shut up Cartman! Cartman, what the hell are you talking about? Sick dude! She's my sister! Crap. No. I mean yes, I mean, what neck brace? Shelley, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that -- that you're my sister, and -- I love you. OW! Someday, Shelley, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me. Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig? Oh, sick! I thought you said the wonder of mother nature was a beautiful thing. Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig. A big mutant version of me?! How big do you think he is? I bet he weighs FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS! Officer Barbrady! My evil genetic clone is destroying the town! We have to find him! It wasn't me, Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone. STOP!! That's good, that's good dude, just calm down. Stan... How would you like to go home and meet your sister? (to Big Stan) So remember, Shelley's the one with a big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back. When you see Shelley, KICK HER ASS. Shelley bad! Shelley very bad!! No! SHELLY Bad! YOU GOOD!! Mom and Dad are home. My house is a disaster. You guys gotta help me!!! You can't just leave me here alone! Thanks a lot!!! It isn't fair! Everybody hates me! The whole town wants me killed! (Crying) Mom and Dad are gonna send me away! I don't wanna be sent away! I want to stay here! WAAAGGHH!!! Shelley, you -- you saved my life! And yet, you've done so much more than that. Today, you've taught me the meaning of family. Sure, families don't always get along. But when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them. By sticking together. I will. It's eight o'clock! My favorite T.V. show is on! Can I eat my cake in the living room, mom? Please? Can I? Aw, dammit. My name's not Billy, grandpa, it's Stan. Sure. I'm not going to kill you, grandpa. 'Cause! I'll get in trouble! Leave me alone, grandpa. I'm not going to kill you, grandpa! G'night grandpa. Whew! Smells like you slaughtered a cow in there, Kenny! Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?  STAN My grandpa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should. Really? Wow. So IS it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison? Don't worry, dude. We can all go watch it at my house! My parents don't get home until late. Yeah... Hey Chef. Bad. Chef, Is it okay to kill your grandpa? No I mean kill MY grandpa. See, I told you, dude. What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this? Hi, Grandpa. I brought my friends over to watch T.V. if that's okay. No Grandpa, I'll get in trouble! No! I can't even kill a deer! GRANDPA!! Come on, Cartman, he's just trying to get to you! We can go watch Terrance and Phillip in the kitchen. Here, Cartman, have some snacky cakes. I don't know what to do, dude. My Grandpa really wants to die. Hey yeah, good idea. Jesus? Jesus, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to because they're in a lot of pain? You know, like assisted suicide. Is that okay? Yes? GOD DAMMIT!! What the hell is wrong with everybody?! Yeah! Kyle, don't be a butthole! Okay, grandpa, okay. Just get out of the way of the T.V. We're not watching Terrance and Phillip, I swear! I mean... CARTMAN was watching it. AGH! We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there watching 'Terrance and Phillip' and -- Yeah! I hope they protest T.V. shows forever! WHOOPEE!!!! Aw, do I have to? Hey, what are you doing? I guess. Okay, you can let me out now. LET ME OUT, GRANDPA!! I can't take it anymore! This music is terrible!! It's cheesy but lame and eerily soothing at the same time!! Grandpa... I... I had no idea how bad it was for you... Now I understand... Sure I will grandpa... I will. Okay, grandpa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest. You got the cow all tied up? Kay, come on, guys. You dumbass, Cartman! It has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted. Are you ready grandpa? Okay, here we go... Bye Grandpa, it was nice knowing you. Whoa... It looks like... death! Hey, he's coming towards US! Mom, death is here and he's trying to take all of us away with him. Yeah, but mom -- Dad, death is coming -- Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on T.V. and more time worrying about what's going on in their kids' lives, this world would be a much better place. Good point man. AAGH!! AAGH!! Hey look! Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time. Whoa... C'mon you guys, let's go home. What do you mean? I dunno... We could start breathing gas fumes... Cool! OH MY GOD! They killed Kenny! Hey, man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready! Shut up, Kyle! I'm Raggedy Andy. Wendy's going as Raggedy Anne. And she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure. Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy! Where'd you get that? No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fat ass! I'll kick your ass, Kyle! You forgot to wear a costume Kenny. Yeah, why is your family so poor, Kenny. Ah, we're ALWAYS running late you ugly skank. I said I can't wait to own a fishing tank. Whoa dude! Wendy? You said we were going to be Raggedy Anne and Andy, remember? We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair! You WHAT?!! He hasn't moved an inch or said anything. Oh Good! Kenny's back to normal! Oh man, I feel like a total chode. Hey, where's Kyle? Whoa, dude! Yea, me too. (muttering) Thanks a lot, Wendy. You RUINED my Halloween! I don't want to trick or treat with you! You lied to me!! I bet I get more candy than you, dude. No no, you're the ASS Master. There's a difference. Oh yeah?! Well, at least MY mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore Magazine!! Oh good you're here. Now, let's make sure we've got everything. Flashlight? Plastic pumpkin pails? Tazer? For shocking people who try to give us granola treats or something. (Sarcastic) How's your barrel full of candy, Wendy? I don't think so, Wendy. I think you've had enough candy for one day! Trick or treat with yourself, Wendy! No buts Wendy, I wish you were dead! Dude, Kenny! Yeah! She had Sweetie Pops! Yeah! That's it, Kenny! You can't trick or treat with us anymore! What are you talking about Chef? (realizing) Oh my God! That means... Wait, where are we going? I don't know about this, Chef. What are we doing here, Chef? What? We TOLD you, dude!! Hey Chef, look! AAAGH!!! Okay, Chef, dial the hotline number!! Chef? Let's get outta here!! We gotta call that Worchestershire hotline! You call the number, Kyle! We'll hold 'em off!! Sweet! Wendy? I know, but... but Hey yeah... Wendy! I know we had a fight, and I did wish that you were dead, but I didn't mean it! I... I can't! Don't worry, babe. Everything's gonna be okay. That's okay, Wendy. I'm sorry I wished you were dead. Oh, man... I can't believe he's gone... Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chainsaw. You know I've really learned something today... Halloween isn't about costumes or candy... It's about being good to one another and giving and loving. Oh... Then what's Halloween about? Oh. (Off-screen) Cartman! The pictures were taken like last month!! Oh, Sweet! Your mom is giving you a big party again this year? Yeah, if MY mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fat ass too. Woa, dude! Hey Cartman, how come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'? Dude! You're not supposed to TELL people what to get you for your birthday! Up yours, Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want! Oh, Green Mega-Man it is. Hey, what do you think you're doing, new kid? Hey new kid! Kenny says he saw your mom drop you off this morning, and she's a REAL DOG! What the -- A what? WHOA!!!! Jesus, Jesus!! No, no, there's a big problem at school! Some new kid showed up wearing all black and Chef thinks he's evil. This new kid keeps throwing things around and saying stuff about his Dark Prince Father coming. He said he wants to talk to you. (To Kyle) Oh brother, now HE'S talking like the new kid. You're gonna fight Satan? I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight or Cartman's birthday? Well, come on, we have to at least see the weigh in. Did The Devil show up yet? Holy crap, dude, Satan is HUGE! Man, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'. Whew! You stink new kid! You smell like a fart! Bye Bye, Fart boy! Hey, Jesus. Sure, dude, you're the son of God. But you're his sparring partner, Chef. But dude, check it out, Cartman's mom made chili. Yeah, YOU aren't invited, new kid! Wow, that was COOL!!! (Walking out) Whoa dude, you need to mellow out. Aw, he does this all the time. Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked! You've got to FIGHT, Jesus! GOD DAMMIT, JESUS SNAP OUT OF IT!!! What would Nancy Karrigan do?! HUH?! Nancy Karrigan wouldn't give up!! When things were looking their darkest Nancy Karrigan fought to be the BEST!! She wouldn't stop until she was NUMBER ONE!!! Nancy Karrigan wouldn't settle for second best!! She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!! What?! Really? Oh... Never mind Jesus, Nancy Karrigan sucks. You know... Somebody once said 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'. YOU did Jesus. No, I saw it on Star Trek. Jesus TOLD you guys not to bet on Satan! OH MY GOD!! THEY KILLED KENNY!!!! You're leaving already? Wow... I feel kinda bad for that kid. Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security? Hey, who's that fat chick? Oh. Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food. Sweet!! I'll call! I know my mom's credit card number!! Hello? Is this Sally Struthers? (Pause) Oh... Shut up, butt pirate, I'm trying to hear! (Into phone) Yes... Yeah, we want to adopt a starving Etheropian. JUST A SECOND, FAT ASS!! (Into the phone) Hello? No, it's a mastercard... (To Cartman) Vas diferens?! Oh. (Back to the phone) Do we get the sports watch right away? (to the other boys) She says we do. (Pointing) You mean like Kenny? Damn! Dude, that's not a digital sports watch. Oh, man! They must have accidentally sent him instead of the Sports watch! Yeah, how'd he make those clicking sounds? I think he said his name is 'Marvin'. Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow! It was MY mom's credit card! This is a great way for you to experience America, Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'All you can eat buffet'. Cartman you butt pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share. He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em, Starvin' Marvin. He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch. No. So why can't he live here now? This sucks. Starvin' Marvin is our friend. Hey, where's Cartman? DUDE! THE MUTANT TURKEYS ARE BACK!!! Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!! Wow... It sucks he has to leave. You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people, but they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials. But people on TV are just as real as you or I. Lights please? (echoing) And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and they were so afraid. And the angel said unto them, fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy. For born unto you this day in the city of David is a Savior, 'tis Christ the Lord. Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. (Louder) And now, SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY PRESENTS -- THE BIRTH OF JESUS! Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle? Christmas poo?! WOW! Christmas snow! OH SICK, DUDE!! No, I think it's against the law, dude. Hey, come on guys, we have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas! We'll catch up with you later, Kyle. What is this about Christmas poo dude? See ya, dude. The whole town is pissed off at each other. It's really sweet. Oh boy, here we go again. (Laughing) Yeah! You guys!! I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas! 'Cause I looked in my parents closet last night! What's that? What's in the box, Dude? Dude! SICK!!! Kyle... I think you better get home and get some sleep. Hello, we need to commit our friend Kyle, please. I wish Kyle was here, it just doesn't seem right without him. This sucks, dude. This is like the worst Christmas I've ever seen! We committed him. 'Cause he kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went. Huh? Uh-Oh! This is horrible. Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution... All because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey. I believe! Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. You know, I learned something today. I learned that Jewish people are OK, and that Hanukkah can be cool too. Well, what could it be? I can't afford a cruise, dude! Shut up Cartman! You can say that again! I'll kick your ass, Cartman!! You guys can stop fighting, it was ME she was checking out. Yeah, that one! No. Sure, Wendy, whatever. Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight! I'd love to! That's not Kyle's lau- We have GOT to learn how to do this, dude. (Coughing) Loser-gift. Loser-gift. See? She liked my present the best! No you're not, I don't think I missed any! I bet I scored a hundred! Oh, hi Wendy. That's impossible. What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her? A what-bian? Kenny? No. Explain it to us, Chef. Oh. Hey, man, if she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians too! You're just saying that Cartman!! What the hell are you doing, Cartman? Well I got a Indiglo girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect. I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am! No, you're a FATTER lesbian than me. Wow. Hi, Wendy. WWOOOWW!!!! Yeah! Oh no, Mr. Garrison's back! Kick ass! Are we making love? They don't have a fireplace here, we shouldn't be making love yet. You have to make love down by the fire. That's what Chef always says. But why? It's because I'm not a lesbian isn't it! I think so! Yup. Yup. Did I WHAT?! Oh my God! She killed Kenny! Wow... I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive... Well, I guess...I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff. Sorry. (Hand raised) Isn't that YOUR job? (This is new) Oh. Dude, shut up, Cartman! What's is it? Woa! What are you gonna do with it, dude? You DID throw it away, Cartman. Well, you might as well let it go. I have a button we can use for his nose! Woa! Yeah, that sucks, dude. So. Like John Elway important? Do you know John Elway? (To the boys) Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway. Why do you want to know, lady? Woa, dude! It's Saturday. Man, the bus sure is late. Fine. Hey, no wonder that Barbara Streisand lady wanted it! Yeah! And you should have seen her nose, it was big enough to land Stealth Bombers on! Yeah! Let us go!! I don't know how much more I can take, dude. OKAY! OKAY! I'LL TELL YOU WHERE THE TRIANGLE IS!!! Woa dude!! Dude, this is pretty fucked up, right here. Get us down from here!! Robert Smith?! Sweet!!! Oh my God!! They killed Kenny!! My mom always said there are no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef... Dude! That's Robert Smith of The Cure! Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot punch! (Into walkie) Quickly, Robert Smith, she's powerless!! He DID IT!!! Wow, Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!! Goodbye Robert Smith!!! Well, what should we do with the two triangles now? Well, at least I have this sweet walkie talkie Robert Smith gave me. Go to hell, Cartman! Yeah, I'm sure glad that's over with! Yeah. Hey, maybe we should ditch school and go check on him. We're not getting on, you fat, ugly bitch. I said 'We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch'. I always wondered if that would work. In the back yard? Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. No, dude... This looks really serious. I think we better get help. No, no. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals. No. Is that legal? Dude, this is gonna be the funniest tape ever made! I dunno, just keep rolling. Wow! Kick ass, dude! We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week. C'mon grandpa?! We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip! This guy sucks! Cartman? What the hell are you doing dressed up like an Indian with a bear necklace? What? What are you talking about, Cartman? Go ahead, dude. (holding out VHS tape) Yeah, we better get this video tape over to Mr. Mackey quick. Come on, Kenny. Get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it!! Yeah, I mailed it last night. What sucks it that now we'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won. Shh! Here comes Cartman! Cartman? Dude, I thought you said you were Native American. Dude, we should be videotaping THIS! We could make ANOTHER ten thousand dollars! Oh my God!! They've killed Kenny!! Huh? Oh, yeah. How about some ice cream! We're in the finals! Man, Cartman's going to be famous. Dude, I can't wait to win that ten thousand dollars on America's stupidest home videos! I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever! How's it going, Cartman? Come on, what's the matter, Cartman? Wow, We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude! Yeah... We have a videotape that's in the finals for America's Stupidest Home Videos... And... And if we win, we'll GIVE you three thousand of our ten thousand dollar prize! Uh... Yeah. Uh... You'll see. We're sure to win Cartman! Then you get your DNA money! Oh my God! They've videotaped killing Kenny!!! Dude! We LOST!! Grandpa!!! Wow, I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but goddamn! (Confused) Oh, hey Kenny... Could you pull over so I can get out? I have to get out first, I'm not gonna make it. I can't stand hospitals! I can't do it, dude! Oh man, I'm gonna be sick... UGH! (Turning blue) AAGHH! I'm gettin' outta here!!! Okay, okay. Let's get out of here now. Oh, weak... Ohhh, dude, when can we get out of here? No way, dude! No. Oh, boy. Oh my God they've killed Kenny! He was a good friend, and I'll miss him. Dude, do you think if we hit him with a shovel he'd shatter? DUDE, you're a big fat ass, AND your mom's a hermaphlight!! Hey you guys, check out these books. (reading the cover) 'Sabrina Unchained'. If we read are we gonna become like that guy? I don't know. Let's go see. Whoa dude! How do you have sex with a chicken! It look's like a note. Yeah, I wonder what's wrong. I don't know. OH MY GOD!! THEY'VE KILLED -- Oh, never mind. (Behind Barbrady) I can't see, dude! No, we just fake it to shut him up. Dude, I think Officer Barbrady enjoys being at school at little too much. Oh, my God! They killed -- Oh, never mind. It's cool dude, we'll help you. 'If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly And the Spotted Spacecraft'! I. A pond. Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond. Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind. What's it say? What's it say?!!! I don't know. Come on dude, it's not that hard! Maybe we were wrong about the clue. LOOK!! Oh my God! They've killed -- God dammit! Uhh... I think that's a mask, dude. What are you talking about dude? That doesn't make a whole lot of sense dude. Cartman! Hey, so what are you going to do now? They want you to give a speech Officer Barbrady, about the whole experience over the last couple of days. I'm sorry Mr. Mackey, mkay? Why do dogs have cold noses? Oooh. Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday? Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris? Welluh dude, you'd better find out! Sorry, Mr. Mackey, okay? Man! That sucked, getting searched. No, dude! We never even saw it! We know, we know, that's what everybody says! Whatta you mean?! Haaa-a bicycle? Your eyes! Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good. Kyle! You have to stop them! Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike! They're gonna chop off his weewee! Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision! Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions. Anduh, and they make it into a party called a bris. Aaaaaaaaaaaa! What are you goin' to do, dude? Dude, I think your mom is going to notice that isn't Ike. Dude, what did you make that doll out of? Come on, dude. If it was your little brother, we'd help you. Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis! Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude. Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea! Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad. Yeah. Naturally. You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine. Uhkay, Mr. Mackey, umkay? Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball. If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins. Dammit, we lost one already! Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup! We're losing men fast out here! No, Cartman. Nobody ever has. Wa- was it wearing clothes? Oh, yeah. Eeww. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! No! I have to get it out! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again? Aw, do we have to? Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals? Whoa! Dude! This is a school? Okay, what have you got? Sweet! Jelly roll is perfect!  Places! Chef, we're hungry. But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese! Dude, Chef has lost it. Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese? Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball! You don't? Damn, dude, China's fucked up! Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Yeah, shut up, Pip!  Can we go home now? Dude, it's the freak nurse! Dude. My uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam. No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there. Whoa! Wow! ü¾ ¼and after killing the entire Viet Cong army, they returned to base camp. Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride.  So was the horror of Vietnam. The End. From a Vietnam veteran. No, no, we didn't- But-eh, but we're not making it up! And wuh- For what, dude? Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth? How? Whattaya mean? Yeah, what a couple of dumbasses. Yeah. Ready, you guys? Okay. Action! Cut! Cartman! It's supposed to be a frog! Wuh since when do frogs talk, Cartman? Okay. Here we go, ready? Action! Come on, Cartman. The way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you. Okay, when I yell 'action,' you start to walk this way.  And Kenny's gonna pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared. It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared. Then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead. Okay? You ready? Good! Aaand action! They deserve it for lying to us, dude! They're here! Hurry and hide! Holy crap, dude. Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real! Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out! We shot all those videos and sent them in. Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'. It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody. Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan. That's a lie. Well I only- did it 'causeü¾ ¼ he- molested me. You big piece of crap! Oh my God! They've killed Kenny! Wull we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble. Mr. Garrison said that there was no way you could have defeated the entire Viet Cong army by yourself. Wait a second-I don't take drugs-that was a lie! No. Your producer did.  She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs. During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie! Well, we're sorry too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world. Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us? Give us some, Cartman! Dude, the road is always snowy. Shut up, Cartman! Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would. Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now. Where are we? I don't think we're in a very safe spot. Dude! Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine. Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kienapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary. I think we have to signal them somehow. Come on Cartman, fart! He can't hold it in forever. Hey, it's happening again.  It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman? Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass. Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay. Now, that was what I call a sticky situation. Do you see 'er dude? No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there! Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus. What time is it? Dude, I think it's Saturday now. Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us. I don't know, it's- a big scary monster. What? Hey, look! Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice. Mr. Garrison, stop! But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun. What was that? Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus! Oh my God! Kenny- killedü¾ ¼ death! Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you. Oh my God, it's killing Kenny! Hoh boy, we're in big trouble. Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this. What? We believe in you, Fonz. Oh my God! They've killed Kenny! You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened! Oh no! Now we need more weight in the back. No, that's too much! I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude. Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. Hey yeah! Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us? Boy, do I! Cartman, no! The bus is going over! Hey! We've landed in ice cream! GAAA-uh.  Ugh. Oh, dude. What a nightmare. Dude, I just had the weirdest dream. Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles. Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems. Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later. Shut up, Pip! Oh yeah, dude. It's summer. That means we have to go buy fireworks. I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt. Jesus, Cartman! The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass. So we'll have ten M-80's, please. Heard what? How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore? Oh my gosh ih killed Kenny! A summer without fireworks is likeü¾ ¼ I don't know, but it's like-uh, ih, it sucks ass. Man, it's hot out here. I know, let's go sledding! Come on, Cartman. Get on. The hell are you waiting for? What the hell's goin' on? Hi, Uncle Jimbo. Yeah, they're not even having 'em at the lake this year. Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer? Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison. That's good. Right. Swimming lessons, dude? That is the lamest thing I've ever heard! Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool. Whatever, dude! But Cartman, we're tryin' to- What does he mean, living in denial? There. How does that look? Nuh, crap. He's taking swimming lessons. How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman? Yeah, they need to shut it off. Man, this sucks! Well we should do what we always do: ask Chef. Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves. How many days left in summer? Dammit, I just want it to snow again! Hi, Uncle Jimbo. There's nothin' to do. Winter's back! Well, I can hardly wait. Hey, Chef. Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too. Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer. She's not my girlfriend. Damn, dude. Look at all these people. Whatcha doin'? Calm down, tubby. Shut up, Cartman!  Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews. They what?! Oh, brother. Dude! Dude! Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know! Yeah, pretty much. The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen. Dude, now that'd be like IMAX. Are they good? Hey, dude, these are good! There is what again? Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble? To the sewer, dude. What was that? Mr. Garrison? What do you mean? Well, why don't you just ask them to leave? Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie. Jeez, they made that into a movie already? Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout! If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout! So what do we do now? Why? Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you. Okay! Sorry. Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this! Blaach! No problem, dude. What the hell is he doing? Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you. Dude, you've got herpes on your face! OOOWWW! Yeah, it's pretty weird. We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny. Catch what? Sshh! Cartman! Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too! Huh? Dude, I think I just saw a rat! I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats. Oh. Goody?? What do you mean, 'goody'?! Chicken po-? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night. Well, you sure seem happy about it! Okay. Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Hahahahah! I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip! Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha. No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip aall day-  Ey! Get me out of here! Homework?! But I'm in the hospital! That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he? Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo. Wait! Where are you going?! Milkshakes?! Weak! And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America. Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead. Yeah. What are you talking about? They did?? Why? Of course! Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chicken pox from Kenny! It's some kind of parental consipracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something. How does someone get herpes? But what if we want to give somebody herpes? My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. And have Shelley kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do! Thanks a lot, Frida! Huh-I don't wanna go back there. Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first? You know, freshen up your breath. Pretty good. Wow, coo-hul! We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff. Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while? I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff. It's boring. Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school? This is stupid. Me neither, butü¾ ¼ I loved the planetarium. I don't know. I don't even remember what happened. Yeah, mine too. Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus! Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez! That's a haiku? Oh. No. Yeah. What's a discharge? Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too. Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon? Where have you been, Cartman? Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial? Dude, what just happened? Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens. Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is- Dude, this isn't right. We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything. Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there. Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see. He hits this switch- Yeah, I guess so. I don't know. This says ""maximum.""  Oh my God, we've killed Kenny! Dude, I told you something was up with this place! ü¾ ¼and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis. Yeah, pretty sure. What other crime in South Park? Oh, no! They got Chef, too! Why are you doing this, dude? Mr. Mackey! Get over here and untie us! Oh my God! Dr. Adams! Yeah. With nobody around to say anything. Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass! No, you don't! Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself! Huh-I donno. Hi, Wendy. ü¾ ¼No. We could? But dude, I don't have a clubhouse. Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in? Truth or Dare? Wow.  Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do. We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help. Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse. How do we do it? Yeah, dude! How'd you know? Dude! Tsk-aw! Sweet! This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse. Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy anduhü¾ ¼ Bebe can come over and play. Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet toob, to play Truth or Dare with them? Because, dude. Wwe could make them ddo really gross stuff, like eat bugs. We're building a clubhouse Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private! Fine! Fine! Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're- 'K. But Mr. Twig sucks. Better than yours, fat boy. Almost. Yes, Mr. Garrison. Um. Yyou said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tenille got- higher ratings. Phew. No, I just- I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the- But I didn't write the note! Shut up, Cartman! Oh, man. What's 'skylarkings'? Who? Oh, no. It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's. Excuse me. Hello? I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you. I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow! My mom won't let us. Pretty good. We're almost done. We're going as fast as we can! Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster. No. I didn't even think about that. And I say, ""Dare!"" ""Truth?"" But that's boring! I want to get ""Dare"" to kiss her. Oooh. Yeah. ""Dare!"" Oooh. You really think so? Wow! Hello? We're working on it. No, you don't!  Dude! Aw, that hunk of fat-  Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse? What?! Why? Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it? ü¾ ¼Dude, you're not supposed to say that! What?! This is happening way too fast. Okay. We're done. It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls. G'oh? Go where? But no! I have to get the girls to come- Weak!  Dad? But I don't understand why we have to- Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too? But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister. What? That's it? I gguess, but- Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute. No way, dude! Don't be silly. We have to say ""Truth"" a couple of times before we say ""Dare,"" right? Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager. To say ""Dare,"" dumbass! Jeez. Oh, hi Wendy. What's up? Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever. Remember, ""Truth"" the first couple of times. Dude! Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes. Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us? Dare. ü¾ ¼Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years! Crap! Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day. What? My dad lets me watch cartoons. Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse! If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me! Oh. Divorce is stupid! Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy! Wow. Clubhouses are magical. Dare. Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy. Really? What's that? What the hell was that? Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?! Yeah, this line is way too long! Here we go. What ride? My ass we will! Yeah, let's not ride that ride again. We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again. Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls? Sorry, Officer Buttbaby. Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say? This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win. He really wants those dolls. Hey, uh this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman. We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go. How long was that? Damn it!  That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that. What are you going to do? Hoh, yeah. That's a good idea. Hold on, Cartman! Come on, Cartman. You okay, dude?  Cartman, hello? Hel-lo? What's the matter with him. But can he still ride a bull? Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me? What?! Oh, he's fine, dude. Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo. How's he doing? Do you think he can ride the bull? Cool. Jesus, dude! Oh, hell! Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride. Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?! There he is! Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours! Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this. I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese protstitute on a bull. Dude, that bull's gonna kill him. Oh my God, they killed Kenny! We did it, dude, we did it! Yeah. And we have $5000 this time. Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden? We should- Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs! Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh. Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling? Oh-h. Nowhere. But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks. That's what Cochran used in the O.J. Simpson trial. Oh no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail. Hello there, Chef. Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up. You do? Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich. Agh. We've gotta help him, dude. Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit! Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass! Could you buy a couple anyway? Our friend, Chef is really- Wow, do you remember him? So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out? Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy? 'Kay. Thanks, dude. Hello? Are you Meatloaf? Our friend, Chef. Wow. So you'll help him? Yeah, thanks.  That's $35 dollars. Come on, you guys. We've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef! Wait, wait. What are you doing? No you don't. You can't take Chef's money! That illeg-! No more Chef. We can't let him down, you guys. No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble? It's easy, dude. Chef Aid. Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets. Cartman just needs to put more into it  Dance better, Cartman! Elton John. What are you doing here? Boy, do we! Yeah, dude. It's all yours! Wow, how'd you get out of jail, Chef? We're gonna raise your money, Chef. Oh my God, Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny's head off! I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today. Cartman, how come you weren't in school today? What? Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve. Dude, this is creepy. Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo! Wow! I don't know. I don't like it. It's spooky. Do I have to? Damn it! Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor. Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch. Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice. Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom? Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest! Why do you keep saying ""hella,"" fatass?! Can you leave the light on, Dad? I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now. Where did it go?  Huhhh. Hey. Where did the shirt go?  I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?! AAAaAaAaAa  I'm not gonna look.  It's not closer. I'm just seeing things. GAAAH!  AAAAAAAH!!  MOM! Mom! Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom! No! AAAAAAAAH! The fish!  But-. WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm! Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-. You're not gonna get away with this! Mom, what are you doing? Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next! But MOM! MMOOMM! No, mom! I haven't been sleeping so well. Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff? Do you think animals can be murderers, too? I haven't been sleeping well. My pet goldfish killed another random person last night. What are you doing?! Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people. What? Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too! Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease. Cartman! Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish? Do you remember what pet store? Where? That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store. Just help me take it back. Come on! Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo! It was the fish! Now we'll never know where that pet store is! Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. Come on, we're running out of time. Yeah, my goldfish-. I know. Come on, let's go!  Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish! I wanna return a fish. Yeah, dude. So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground? We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe. Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish. I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me! Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman! Yeah! I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night. You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman. Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care. We won, dude! Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! Why don't you goys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway. Get to the stage! Up yours, evil twin! Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe! Our Cartman would never say anything like that. You tricked us, Cartman! But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I? I don't want your lame-ass supper! Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old!  I don't need this stupid family anyway! Okay, let's go! 'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry! So, how far is it to Nebraska? Yeah. Or, we could not. This is Nebraska? Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraka? He's the fat one. Sick, dude. Yeah, right! My family's dead! They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here. Dude, is he here every year like this? Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here. What, dude? Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans. What was that? I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming. We thought you were in jail. Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall. All families suck ass! Do you really think we should go with this guy? Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go. I really like that guy. Mr. Hankey? You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you. Oh, boy. You've done it now. Where did you go, Uncle Charlie? Hey. Where's Kenny? Oh, hey Kenny. There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us! Oh ooh. ü¾ ¼Sorry. Dude, they're gonna kill me. 'Scuse me. I wanna go with you. Please, I don't wanna go back with them. I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place. What?! But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me. I guess you're right, Uncle Charlie. Thanks. I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom. Really?? Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What? That's okay with us. Oh, not Tweek. Dude, we can't work with this kid. No. Okay, we have to do this stupid report, sooo- Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about. Great. A lot of help you are, kid. What? What gnomes? Yeah, I've neve seen any underpants gnomes. Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it. 'K. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow. Wow, that sucks, dude. Yeah. Kind of bitter. Yeess, this stuff rocks! Whoopee! Yeah, mine too. I wonder why. Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed! Bad! No, we'll use it. Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks! Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine. Huh?? Our case? Uh. Hooray. Uh. I like small businesses. Your dad really screwed us, Tweek! 'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original! Yeah, that makes sense. How do we stretch that into five minutes? What the hell? Hey there, little guy. Hey, he talks! Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants? Business? Wait, do you know anything about business? Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?! Damn, dude, this place is huge! I don't get it. No you don't, fatass! Oh my God, they killed Kenny. Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed. Do you know anything about corporate takeovers? Underpants? Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations. Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay! Holy crap. dude! This guy rules! Yeah! Dude! Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle! Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue! Hey, he's still alive.  Kyle, are you okay? Can you climb back up, dude? Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him. Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch. Sorry.  What the hell are you doing, fat boy?! All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this? He's like, some frozen guy. Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends. You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope! Help me chip some of the ice away. Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward? Where shall we bring it? I think I'm going to name it Gorak. Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? You didn't find him, I found him. You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out. Huh, excuse me? I found this frozen guy in the woods today. Really. Wait a minute! His name is Gorak! Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak. No, it isn't! I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick! No, I'll go! I found him! Oh my God, they revived Gorak. Uh. Hi. He said, ""hi."" He wants to know where he is. You'reü¾ ¼ home. Dude, you've been frozen 32 months. Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him. Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend! Fine! He doesn't look very happy in there. I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman! You guys aren't being very nice to my creature. Let him out, dude. He's scared. Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Gorak!  Gorak! Gorak! Are you there? I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out. What are you doing here? What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak. His name is Gorak! Gorak! What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?! No he doesn't!! I found him, I'm rescuing him! You're a dick! You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you! Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock! Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3. I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean.  Wait. Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy! You suck as a best friend, Cartman! What are you doing, Gorak! Wow, that sucks, dude. What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock! Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick! Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my respnosibility. I'll take him to Des Moines! Come on! We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please. My friend, Gorak! No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole! Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock. 'K. O-okay. 'K Ow! Watch my coat, dude. Huh? No problem, Gorak. Yup. Right on. Hisü¾ ¼ nameü¾ ¼ isü¾ ¼ Gorak! They're after you! Where's Gorak?? Wait, look! The helicopter! He's alive! Kyle, Steve was aü¾ ¼ pretty good name for that guy. Could we be best friends again?  I hate having Cartman as a best friend. Choirs suck. It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing. What?! But we don't even care about the rainforest. Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please! Nooo-ho! No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right. Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. Aaah! Snake! Oh.  Aaah! Snake! Oh. AAAAAAA! SNAAAKE! AAAAAAA! I'm just a-scared of snakes. Dude! Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!! I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme. This doesn't look very safe. Hey. Maybe Cartman was right. Holy crap! Jesus Christ! Run run ruuun!  Waaah! We're sinking. All we ever heard growing up was, ""Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile""! Oh, now she figures it out. Wow! Oh my God, they killed Kenny. They did. You know, ""they."" Help ...him? Is this what you're looking for, Kyle? Why is that funny? That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection? Oh my God, they killed Kenny! He just... ignited. Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on. Wow, that was short. The what? I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible. Dad, where's our Bible? Or else what? ...What? Where's our Bible? Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death? ...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection. Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets. Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate. Station Two: Jesus takes his cross. And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him. Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross. Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, ""Thanks."" And then Jesus was lead away  to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrurection three days later. This spot looks good. Okay, cool. See you, Cartman. Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess. Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection. Whoa, dude, my dad's famous. Wow, he died. Cartman?? Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus. (Sick, dude!) (Okay, okay, just go away!) Uh. We've been taking care of him. Apples? (Dude!) (I don't think I like this new law.) Yeah. Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad! Dude, he's still not dead. That's not your mom calling! He is right. It has been getting really hot lately. Hey, yeah! Dad, where's the phone book? Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect? Oh. Uh, it... sucks ass. Oh my God, what's going on? Dude, that's my dad! I know, huh? He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do. What are you doing, dad? No, he's not! He can't even get a nurection! Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution! Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross. See, at first, Jesus was all like, ""Why me?"" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying, he raised his hand and said, ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."" It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime. Huh? Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference? Dad. Dad! Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started! See? My dad is the coolest after all. Cartman! He's been up there for like, three weeks. That's amazing! Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch. Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman? Why do you have to see an eye doctor? Where's Chef? Why did Chef quit? Could you just hand us some food please? Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back. Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today. But why? Why would you quit? So you made sweet love to her down by the fire. Talked?! That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?! What the hell is going on?! She's stealing Chef from us. Wait you guys.  Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? ...Yeah, screw that bitch. Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow. We wanna talk to Chef. And a chef hat. Huh? Chef, you have to dump the bitch! But we don't like her. I don't know-uh. No reason I guess. Dude! He bailed on us! Come on! We're going to his house! You forgot! Oh no! No nononononono! Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time. What's a succubus? Yeah! Wow, you are smart, Mr. Garrison! Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him. Who are you? Chef, we have to talk to you! You're Chef's parents? No, that's okay. He wanted money? Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here? Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! Damn, your eyes must really suck, Cartman. Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us. We know what you are, lady! A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men! I guess Jesus dude! Excuse me!  We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news. Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him Chef, but- No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us! Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them. Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus. What the hell does that mean? Right. Yeah? Oh-hoho! That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards. We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song.  You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman?? God-damnit! You can't fall asleep. There she is! Bitch. Bitch. Bitch. All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front. Here it goes Now, Cartman! Come on Cartman! Oh my God! She killed Kenny! We're sorry Chef, we had to do it! We'd love them! Where are you going? So? You can poo in the wilderness. Not here! Go further away! Sick, dude! We don't wanna look at it, Cartman! I see it! I saw it this way! Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way! I think his name is Junjun. Who's that? One of your mom's boyfriends? Wow No, he's annoying. Why don't we just tell our parents? Sshh! Be quit. We could get in big trouble for being here. Sh! Keep quiet, stupid! Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond? God-damn! Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around? Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing. Dude, it's crowded in here. Oh, no! Nothing's worse than Cartman with authoritah! Oh, he'll win. Don't worry. Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that. Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is. Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies? Tweek is! Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls. I don't know. He's such a wuss. No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss. How much? You're on! Hey Tweek. Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight. Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight? He's really got it out for you, dude. Super. See you there. Mr. Adler! Mr. Ad-ler! The bell rang. Can we go? Come on, you guys. This is gonna be so sweet, dude. You're on, fatass! How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny? Aw, hell! Tweek? How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?! Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, ""Man, Tweek's a wuss,"" and we were all like, ""No he's not, Craig,"" and he was all like, ""Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"" Yeah, it was weak. Tomorrow? Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45. Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed.  All right. Here we go. Well? Huh? Aw, dude, come on!! All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight. All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig. Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box! Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow! Damnit! Okay, the time has finally come. You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on! Ye-hah! Come on, Tweek! You got him! Yeah. Here they are. Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching. Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig. Hey, you guys. How are you feeling? Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you. So I guess we'll be gong now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies. Well, I mean, that's what was on the news. Ogh, dude, get me out of here! You would think that, you little ass-sucker. An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker. What? No you can't, you little ass-sucker! Hoh, whatever! I called you an ass-sucker! What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time! Wwhat do you mean? Uh... I'm eight? Huh??? I have to give him half my stuff?? Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy. Uh, no! I hate that toy! Damnit! Where's our desks? You see, Cartman? You see what this has done? Bad. Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits? Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him! 'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please. We want Sexual Harassment Panda. Well, where is he?! What the hell is wrong with these people?! 'Scuse me. Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here. ...Coats? Dude, what the hell is going in?! Well, we don't take kindly to you! Come on, we'd beter hurry. ""Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune."" This must be the place. Whoa! Who are you? ...Thanks a lot, dude. Have you seen any panda bears? Oh my God! They killed Kenny! Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick! Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other. Okay, yyou are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new massage that people will find useful again. No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say. I don't want to go to this stupid party! No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels. Awww! I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins! No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school! Shut up, Pip. Butters, is there any way out of here? Oh my God. No. Yes. Oh, dude, you've gotta be kidding me. Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone! What? What do I have to do? Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast. What, Pip? What the hell do you want?! You did? We're going upstairs. Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs! Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set. I don't care, just hurry! Rad! There are no more missions. I have everything I want. Just... play something else! God! Whoa, cool! Wait a minute  Oh my God!  Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult! :	Dude! Hey you guys! We've got a big problem! The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them. Mom, go look outside. Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves. We don't have any weapons. Get back inside! Dad! Dad, they shot at us. Mom! Get ahold of yourself, man! Come on. We have to find out what's happening. Sh! We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party. Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real. Tell them not to burn us down. Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters. You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job. Oh no, we're out of time!  Are you sure you can do this, Butters? We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there. Can you hit a target, Pip? Hit something nice and solid now. Nice job, Pip. Alright, Butters. Now it's your turn. He made it down. But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along. This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt. Christmas? W-we weren't scared! That's just an old legend. I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them! Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary. Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts! Come on, fatass, we have to go! Yes you can, porky. Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders. What's the scariest thing we could get? No!  A dead body. We could never make one that looks real enough.  To be really scary, it would have to be real. We're gonna dig up Kyle's dead grandma. Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right? All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone, Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to. Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted! Well, let's dig 'er up! Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary! You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?! Yes you do! Now, dig! Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three!  Whoa, dude. Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh. Okay, grab the sled. Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders. Who was that? Dude, not cool. This is scary. Hay, you're that band KoRn. What are you guys doing out here? Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders. Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back. Yeah, dude. It's right over there. Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes. Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go! Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever. Where's your costume, fatass? Hey, Kenny. Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma! This is gonna be sweet What's the problem? She has to be here! We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away. Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside. How should we split up? This place gives me the creeps. We've got to hide! Ow! There she is! Oh, no! The pirate ghosts are back! Boo! Hey, fatass. Yep. I got: Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe. What are these? They're Chinpokomon! Yeah, like ancient history. No, dude! Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective. The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power. Ogh! Kyle, get with the times, dude! Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller? Dude! The video game gave Kenny a seizure. How's it goin', fatass? What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp? We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure. Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp. You didn't know that? Dude, did you just say ""a-ight""? Yeah, dude. Nobody says ""a-ight"" anymore. Can you see anything? It's starting, it's starting! Juuhachi desu ka? Juuhachi is 18, Garrison-san. He said, ""Garrison-san sabuchii da naa!"" Yeah, dude. That was totally gay. Totally gay. Kore wa watashi no uchi desu. Nan da kore? What? You like it? No.  Screw this, dude. Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something. Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football? Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore. No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused. ...Ye-eah. Oh. Wait.  Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes. I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before. Damn, dude. Those home-schooled kids are smart. We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something? What's that? Shut up, Cartman? You shut up,  gaywad! Nno, we're friends. What? Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos. Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground. You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass. Come on, Pip, say it. Say ""Please, hit me."" No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say ""Please, hit me,"" I won't hit you. All right. Alright, we'll try this again, Pip. Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own. Aw, man, if you have to. Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now. Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff. Ah, dude, you don't say that. Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling. Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going? Well, get your ass out of bed!  We have to go deal with that home-school kid! But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole. Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny! Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole. Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe! Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help? Oh, brother! You suck now, Kyle! Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle! Hey, you're pretty cool, Mark. Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark? Nice speech, nerdo. What?? * I told you, fatass. Sshh! We don't know. Whatever. Let's go see what's on TV. Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news. Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing. Kick ass!  Wow, this thing is awesome! Wow! This is great! Yeah, that's better. Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world. What the hell did you hit, Cartman?! We're on like, some foreign planet. Uh, thanks. U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth. Cool! Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here. Uuh. Thanks. Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar. What?? Oh. Run for it! He's not done for, he's standing right there. Alright, we made it! They're shooting at us. Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself. You dumbass, Cartman! You got 'em, Marvin. Sally Struthers is saving us! Now's our chance! We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us. Wow! Good job, dude! Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again. Maybe we'll come and visit sometime. Dude! I know, but you don't tell him that! That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer! Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4. Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute! Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna lethim in the reenactment. He'd better! Dude, that's not cool. Cartman, what the hell are you doing? You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass! Hoohoo what a d'humbass! It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave. Cartman, you can't do that! Run for your life, dude! Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit! Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas. Oh here comes the bus.  Butters? Are you the only one that came back? What battlefield?! God damnit, that fat piece of shit! That would suck so much ass. I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters? Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought. Dad, Dad.  Mom wants you to come home. Oh, my God! They killed Kenny! I know! But we'll have to wait until dark. There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home. Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave. Haha! You lose, fatass! Where are you going? Oh, no. Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here. No, you can't do that. Our dads are there. Aw, damnit! Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves. Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do? Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy. Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering. It's finally over, Cartman. You lost! Don't touch me. Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is- What's going on? ...Oh, it's that Channukah thing Let me try. I'll try to make it spin. It fell; I'll try again. I'll try to make it spin. It fell; I'll try again. I'll try to make it spin. It fell; I'll try again. I'll try to make it spin. It fell; I'll try again. I'll try to make it spin. It fell; I'll try again. I'll try to make it spin. It fell; I'll try again. I'll try to make it spin. It fell; I'll try again. AAAA! Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome. No you didn't! How do you know? You're making that up!  Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period? Please, it's important. Dude, Cartman can't hit puberty before us. Hello? No, there's no blood coming out of my ass. Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's eve, then screw him anyways. Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's. So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's eve with us? You did? Are you there, God? Damnit! Damnit damnit damnit! I'm not bleeding out my aahass! No it's not! It's terrible!  Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's eve. Please, please give me my period soon. Hey, Chef. Bad. Can I come in? Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't. No. Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't. Yeah, Cartman told us. Okay. ...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed becuase everybody has their period at a different time. But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year old boy! I'm gonna do someting about it! But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty. Nn-nobody! I mean, uh, well, m-my dad. No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarassed to come himself. So do you know anything that can help him? Hormones? Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best! Hey assholes! Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones! Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's! So what are we gonna do for New Year's? Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones. Who-o-oa, du-ude. I've got boobs. Have I missed anything? No. I didn't, but- Jesus, why does God hate me? He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me. Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted? What do you mean? I just wanted my period. I have it. I have the question.  Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?! Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before! Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay.  I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh? What's Arkansasü¾³¤¼is that a state? What's ""lose bowel control?"" Who's Karen Carpenter? Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting. We're not rednecks! Why?! Don't you know?! Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again! Damnit! You did? Damnit Cartman, wha-?! Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading! Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means. No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em. What word could we make up? No, uhno, not finkleroy. Yeah, mung. Sh. Here they come. You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung? We busted you! It is? Ooogh. You dumbass, Cartman! I have no idea. I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids. You found what? No way. Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking? No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids. Howdo we write he note, Cartman? Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played. Come on.  There.  That should do it. Okay, let's get back to the room. Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants. Oh no, dude. Look!  It's the music we changed! Stop! Stop! Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means. Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here. Uuuuh You do? What the hell's wrong with Cartman?! Two dollars! For one tooth? Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter. I already lost all my baby teeth. Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there? What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's. Uh, Butters, could we have it? Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth. I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight. Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there? Well? Oh my God! Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow. Dude, where's the money? What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega! Tell us what?! Dude. You guys! You guys! I figured it out! Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast! Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right? So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it! The kid will never even know. We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there! Come on, Kyle! Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  ""Tooth Fairy."" There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it. This is the smartest business venture ever. Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?! ...Hey, you can't do that! Because that's what we're doing! You scram! We were here first! You woke him up! Who's the Boss? Uuh, yeah. Damnit! And we thought we were so original! Well, uh-what do you mean? What's a ""tooth trade?"" Amazing. Oh. Uh-I don't know. How much do we get if we work for you? We're in! We all want double-desserts today! U-uh, Chef. Chef! CHEF! We're not dealing drugs! No! Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules! We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses. Dude, just stop thinking about it. Kyle? Aw, shit. What? Really? So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'? We win again! Sleds are for guys. Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else. You got it! Noo problem! Oh, boy! We'll show them! Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice. Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday? Hello? Son of a bitch! Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday. Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park? Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid. Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! Nice going, fat boy! Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid! Come on, let's get it a try. Yeah- Dude, bail! Bail! Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny. We Killed Kenny. We're bastards. Nothing else is gonna work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls. You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted. That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail! I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it. Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you! Yeah, you stupid umbassday! ...Yeah. Sshh! How are we supposed to give them to you? But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell. Alright, here. Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that. That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time! Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity. Yeah. Hi. Can Token come out and play? Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you? It's not? Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself? Okay, go ahead and start. Oh, uhyeah.  Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, ""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocracy.""  Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws. If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government? Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same. That is our presentation. An idea that we call... Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second. Alright, where's Clyde. Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit! It's Cartman! All right! Let's do this! Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! We're not gonna make it! We did it! Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again. I know! Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded. But he is- He doesn't have to do homework? I've got ADD. Dude, it's Timmy. Yeah, Timmy ruhules! But he's funny. He looks pretty happy to me. Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is. Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff. Because we're on Ritalin. Oh boy oh boy. But there are no side effects, Chef. See what? Let's watch something else. Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up? Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter. Sounds good. Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny. Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow? Sure was, Dad. Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice. I feel... different. Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass! Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy! No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be ""protected"" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules! Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns Where?  Oh, no.  Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye.  No, thank you. Go away, please. Two hours. Damn, dude. Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in? Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over. Dude, this isn't working. Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! I'm tired, Grandpa. I don't know.  Whoa. Hurry up, you guys! Dude, you're not gonna believe this. Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania. Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville? Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first. Okay, hold it, hold it. What?! Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they? They have nowhere else to go.  Please? That's your dad? Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send tham back, are you?? No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! Okay, let's try it again. Hup! No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America. Now what do we do? Damnit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus! The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us. Yeah! Well, not this time! We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side!  Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now! Uh, sure, you can all get overtime. Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets! Come on, angry mob! Yeah. Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways. Whatever happened to Kenny? Dude, I don't understand this game at all. Um, deny it? Sweet. Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS. You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight! Oh, man, that's terrible. Haha, he-yeah ha.  Haaaaah. Blaaa-lalalalalalala. We're making faces at sick people. We don't know. You're not more mature than us, Cartman! Yeah. Now what are you going to do? We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway! Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature. We got invited too, fatass This is boring. That seems kind of... weird. Yeah. Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us! Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide! Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out. Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you. And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends? Here! Dude, what the hell was that? ...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk. You have to be drinking milk for that to happen. He's fakin'! Now, that's a get-well card! Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher. Go on, Butters! Butters, go on! Dude, you really are sick, huh? Uh excuse ne, but, what do these toxins look like? Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin? What? Those aren't toxins. That's the been with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago. Don't be a smartass? Hi, doctor. Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick. But I don't think it's working. Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world. ...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care. Who?  Oh, shit. Cartman, we have to ask you a quuestion. A very serious question. Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life. What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney. His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working. Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle? But you only need one, fat boy! Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?! Oh my God! Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die! What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?! Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities? Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't. Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what thry're talking about? And that has something to do with their medicines because...? Nobody wants to listen, Kenny. I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again. I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do.  Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live! Come on, where are they? This is it?? This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle?? Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me! We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney. Okay, it's clear.  Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy. Sshhh! If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright? Alright Butters, let's go.  Uh-oh, Cartman's pig.  Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay.  Come on, we gotta get outta here!  Oh, no! Oh, phew. Okay, here we go. .Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here... ...vein right, well-  Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up. No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?! You suck, Cartman! God-damnit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?! There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend! My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it.  Oh, God, he's my best friend... Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again! So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital? That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan. Dude, please. Kyle needs it. Alright, alright, here. You look a lot better. Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do. Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you! It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put catchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney. Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been? You don't even know what you're debating about half the time! Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it. Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag. Islam?? Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed. Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is. But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about. Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this! I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side. Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints. Do you think they should change the flag? That was a good one. Wait, I don't get it. Boy band? Dude, we don't have any musical talent. He's right. Well, I guess. Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall. Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it. Cartman says we can make $10 million. Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that. Uuuh, next is Ike Broflovski. Aw, come on, dude. Let her try. Come on, nobody's gonna notice. She's the best chance we have! I say she's in. Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early? Costumes? Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair? Hey, Cartman, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, anyway? Kenny says that's not what it means. Uh oh, mall cops. Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager. Yeah. Uh oh. We are making a music video. Dad, I was just a- Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends? Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting. No. Dad! It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?! Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me. I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever- Dad? What the hell is going on? Jesus Christ. ...I never knew. ...Oh-kay. Dad? Well,... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had. Yeah. Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done. Really?? Alright! Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Oh, yes we do. You were great, dad. Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have. Bo-ring. Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's..."" ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-"" Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school. We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! Are we gonna go to hell? What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives. But crackers are his- body. Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him. No?? Confession? Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days. And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 munites. We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell. Have you confessed all your sins yet? Dude, this ledy told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period. Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat onfire? What, Butters? Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something. I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo- Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up! The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight. I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy. ...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble- God damnit! Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy.  Sister Anne? We have a question. Where do handicapped people go when they die? But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell? What happened?? I don't think so. Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on. Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more. Cartman! Dude, you just said ""ass""! That's a sin! Oh, shit!  Oh! But what about them? Okay, come on. Come on! This stupid light won't change. We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again. Uh, come on, let's go. ...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! He's doomed. Oh no! It's locked! Confession box is over there! You're a sinner! Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us? Let's go. ...they've killed Kenny! Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us? Don't you guys, um, persecrute our religous beliefs. What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven. There's no way God will want to send us to hell now. Wow, cool. Yeah! What? Kenny?!  What's he say?! Dude, that seems- kind of- weird. What worked? Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars? Well, what about going to hell and all that?! Dude, I an so disillusioned right now. Yeah! Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up.  Hey, come here What grade are you going into? Stupid third grader! Denver? Alright.  Hey, listen up everybody! We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical! Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, ""KISS MY ASS!!!"" all together! ...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters. Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, ""KISS MY ASS!!!"" We got you covered, Timmy. Dude, look at the walls.  Everythng is written in some strange, foreign language. ...More like, Ms. Makesmesick. What a bitch! This is it. The end of innocence.  This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about. Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade! We travel back in time. It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time. We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there. Back in the third grade. Oh! Here she comes. Yeah! Timmy, you have to stop! No?? So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows? My God! Over here, over here! Less than 20 minutes?! Well, who didn't see that coming? ...nine, eight... Dude! You gotta build us another time machine! W-what did you get in a fight about? Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me! Alright, come on, guys.  Man, I can't bellieve we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time! God-damnit, this is ridiculous. Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade? I know. Wiait a minute! I've got it. Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were! Oh, son of a bitch! Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said. Dude. Sh-she's right. Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?! Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us. But isn't he only three years old? Cool! Wow, cool! Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus. But they smell like pee. Aren't you a little old to be in grade school? Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours? Oh, dude, here comes that weird new kid. Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper! What the hell just happened? Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby? Wow, that's amazing What do you think, Officer Barbrady? Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity! Yes! So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby? Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper! Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was THIS Trapper Keeper and not the one before! Cartman! Yeah, that's fine...  No, wait! Can I do it? Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fatboy! Whoa. Yeah, or we could just kill him. He's right there. Uh oh. Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom! You break it down! Not it! You lose, Kenny. ...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! Then we have to stop it before it gets there! Cartman, you have to stop! He is in there. One-two-three not it! Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to. No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell. This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened! He did it! You did it, Kyle!  Kyle saved your life, fatass! Oh, that's a bitch. 'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do. E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh. 'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace. Uh-eally? Uh you think so? Oh yeah, we can't! You do? Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay. Where's Gobbles, Timmy? No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me. Helen! Oh no! Okay, here we go. I can't do it, dude. Too bad Cartman's missng this. He must be really sick. That's so gross. I'll throw in five. forty-one bucks.  Eww-ho-hoo! He did it! Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. Well, at least you got it out of your system. Oh, you guys! You know, dude, there might be something to this. We knew he wouldn't make it. I don't believe it. Did you like the old one? We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing. What's a prostitute? Chef, what's a prostitute? Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it? Chef, what's a prostitute? Chef was just about to tell us what a protitute is. Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he? Like what? No. Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever! Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up? You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York! For giving Howard Stern a hummer! I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months! I know! Deal, druggie! Dude!  You're not gonna believe what Cartman has! We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out! Well, of course your parents said you can't go! Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it. The police? But what do the police do to them? Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too. What's going on? ...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours. You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes. How come you wanna help the fatass?! You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel! You mean in the Before time? In the long, long ago? If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass? Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the Before time again. Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birthgivers' laws. But the birthgivers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli. And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birthgivers disappear. , by using the magic M word. Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry. So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago. Yes. No foolies. Awesu-home! No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel! It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight. Parents? He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around. Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute! Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner. Hey, you guys came back! Huh. A-ah huh. Ho-o-oh. What is this all about, Kyle? I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore. Nobody's paying any attention. This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas. Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads? And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this. What, dude? We don't know anything about animation. Yeah! And we can call it... ""The Spirit of Christmas"" It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget. Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em! That's not me, that's you! No, that's okay. Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending. Hey! Wait a minute! Aren't you Jewish, Kyle? Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs. You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! What's awesome? That's not in the script They do this all the time. Easy. Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas Okay.  One. Kickass! Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. E mouths... 1  2. ""We wish you a m- Merry"" AAAAAAAA! That took us half an hour to set up, fatass! We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it! Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing! We love Tralala We sit. Tralalalala ""Awgh! I'm so fat!"" ""Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!""  STAN I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help? Cartman: Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! We wish Tralalalala We sit. Tralalalala ...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film. Hey! Wait a minute! Aren't you Jewish, Kyle? (voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas! You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs! For nothing. Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu. Christmas still is about one very important thing. No not ham! ...Christmas is about something much more important! Presents. Don't you see, Kyle? Presents. What? Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool. So? What?! They can't say ""shit"" on television! Holy fucking shit! Aw, come, on dude! This is history. Sshhh! Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say ""shit?"" Where are you going, Kyle? But you're gonna miss it! The, they're gonna say ""shit"" and you're gonna miss it! Oh. I can't believe they actually said it. Wow! We can say ""shit"" in school now?! Me neither. This suck. Now that ""shit""'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore. What's meecrob? What? What's that? What's the Black Death, Chef? Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here. Word of curse? Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death. Holy shit! Uh oh. Now what are we gonna do, Chef? Oh shit! What are we supposed to do with it? It might hold the key to a curse. Dude, we need help from the British! You know what it is? Well, yeah, but I don't think that ""curse word"" meant... curse word. Look, there's the F-word. All the world destroyed? Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back. And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English. It's gonna suck. There's gonna be all like, new kids there we don't know. Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad. Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy?? Hey, it's Big Gay Al! See ya, Dad! Jimmy's funny, dude. Hey, I have a great idea. Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club? Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow? Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time. You were right, Dad. Scouts is awesome! We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle! And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome! Cartman, don't say ""use him,"" you big thilly goose. I just... called Cartman a name - he's a, he's a silly goose. But dad, I was just tryin' tuh- ...Asshole. Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number four seven. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy! Heheh. Big Gay Al, what are you doing?? Kicked out? Oh no! Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy.next week. What do we want? When do we want it? What do we want? When do we want it? What do we want? When do we want it? What do we want? When do we want it? Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures. Alright, let's set up.  Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays? Uh, hello, gays in Scouts?  Goddamnit! That's a great idea!  Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy! Dude, this looks like it could get ugly. Jesus Christ, dude! We did it! We did it! Huh? So wait, did we do good? Dude, Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts! What's going on? How'd he do that?? No way! His a-miracles? Yeah! Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea. No, I'm Stan. Who are you? Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here. Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home. I don't care! I'm leaving!  'Scuse me. I'm going home. You said we're free to leave whenever we want Move out of the way. I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave. That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay. Okay, it's all clear. We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand. Come on, Kyle, this is stupid! A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?! No, they just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go! Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here! Oh wait, who am I again? Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second.  Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come back with me! Kyle, please.You-  You're my best friend. HaaAAAA! Hi, Jesus. It's me, This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome! I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special. Can you do it agian? That's it? That's how you did that trick? That trick sucks, Jesus. Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out. But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick. Then what are we going to do. Super best friends? To where? I am ready. Yeah. So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends? Wow. I knew it. Wow, the Moses. Kyle! Kyle! Kyle??  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! Kyle?  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! Kyle! Kyle, you can't kill yourself! Kyle, you have to hold yoru breath! Oh, very funny! Listen up, everyone!  You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all. Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle. What's no big deal? Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair. He's lying. We don't wanna see them, Cartman! What?? Cartman, you are so Goddamned stupid it's unbelievable. When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass! One please. Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you? Oh my God, he killed Kenny. Got what all figured out? Yeah. This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman. Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet? Jesus Christ, dude! Who are you? Oh man, this is another rerun. Because I had an itch up my ass. When are they gonna make new ones? What's this? Enough! I know! Dude! Did you get 'em? Yep. Tomorrow night. Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night. No, dude, we really, really do. Huh? Yeah, he looks terrible. Uuuuhh. Phillip? That's not Phillip. Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottm of this.  'Scuse us. It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club. You don't understand: we saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once. Man, this sucks! I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts. We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here. But where's Phillip? Becuase, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip. What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us? Oh no, dude. They're not together anymore, dude. But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now. Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end? Phillip! Phillip! Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act. Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and- But we need you! He'll do it, dude. Two thousand dollars. Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there. I'm sure they'll be here any minute. Oh my God! Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catchng up to do. But let's rehearse first. Fine! Okay. Okay, I think we lost them. Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason. Go! Run run run! Come on, Kenny, hurry up! They're back! It sure did. ""There you are, Jennifer Lopez!""  ""You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez."" ""It's too late for that, Ms. Lopez."" Yeah, awesome!  ...Why? You'd better not be lying, Kenny. Oh my God. Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket? Yeah, it's unbelievable. Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money. Kyle?  Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle? Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but- Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already. Oh, hey dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start. What that? Heh, heh.  Sorry. Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins. That does it, dude! We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not! Come on, dude! Aw, crap. Dude! Alright, let's go. You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fastass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better! You'll see! We'll get in! Dude, are you okay? Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I wa thinking we could put on disguises and get in. Jesus. Goddamnit Cartman, let me in! It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole! AAAH!  This isn't over, Cartman! Kyle, you gotta see!! Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached? Then damnit man, do it! Look, Kyle. Look. Kyle! ""That's what you said last time , but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures"" ""Scream for me, bitch!"" Oh no, what now? Cartman, what the hell are you doing? Whoa, cool! I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again. Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders? Mom! Dad! You gotta see this! But it's super-cool! Red rocket, red rocket! I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket. My room? Why? No! Why?! What's the big deal?! I was doing ""red rocket"" to make the dog's milk come out. Huh?? What things?? No! Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey? It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'. Yeah.  Hey Wendy, did you guys get- You guys, we just wanna know if you- Why? ...A what? Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything. But Wendy, we don't understand how thatt- Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick. Yeah, we need condoms! Why does that matter? Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side. Doesn't it give any other directions? Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo! How do you feel? Alright, here, everybody.  Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on. Man, this condom's driving me crazy. From sex?? All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases! Yeah, come on guys, this is war! Ha! They're your diseases! That does it! Attack! We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases. But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex? Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy? HA, I blew your head off! Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom? Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet. Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game! Yeah. Hay Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom. What is it, Mom? The 2001 Okama GameSphere? There it is. The Okama GameSphere. What's that? Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend.  It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday! What? Dude, we got GameSphere. What? ...O-kay. No. G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere. Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit! Well, it's alright. We can still play for  six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball. Okay, we will. Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it! No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer. Oh, uh, I'm sick. But Mom... Can't believe we have to go to school! We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere. Fine. This is gonna be one looong-ass day. That was the longest day of school ever! It... it was right here. Hello? What? Who-who is this? Don't hurt it! They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere. Towelie! I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him. This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him. Hey yeah.  Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool!  Aaah. Let's go take a shower!  Let's go waterskiing! Come on, dude! They said the gas station outside of town. Who is that? 'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games. You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back. Goddamnit, what now?! Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somwhere. Where is our Okama GameSphere? Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie? Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. A little more gas, Kenny. Brake, Kenny, brake. Dude, don't you remember where it is? Alright, so where is it? Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny!  Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you! What? Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is? We don't care. Dude, we don't care. We... don't... care. Don't care, don't care, don't care. Can you tell us where ""that"" is, please? We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf? Yeah. What? So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school? Hurry up, stupid parachute! Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks. Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine!  Here's your stupid lighter. No, Towelie, the entry code! God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence. Do you have our Okama GameSphere? Oh God, don't care, don't care. So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp. But we don't care! We're just going in to get our video game back. Hello? Hello, anybody here? Ohmigod, look! Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays. Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny! Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! Aw, crap! Come on, guys. Let's go play video games! Oh, dude, we finished level 50! :	Butters, what the hell are you doing? Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax! There's nothing you can do except stop breathing. Hey Mom, door bell's ringin'. Hey, look at what the postman brought me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan! We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return!  Do you have some scissors to get this open? :	Well alright. We got a package from the kids we sent dollars to. They sent us something back. Oh, it's just a goat. Hey there, little guy. I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars. :	Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle. Kenny? My parents will never let me keep a goat No, we're not gointa kill it, Cartman! We'll just have to  take the return address and mail it back to the kids in Afghanistan. Come on, goat. Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please? They're not. Well yeah! The military planes. Come on, goat, we'll put you on one of them. I don't care! We're going! Okay, thanks, Towelie. Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie! Alright, come on. We just gotta get the goat on one of these planes. Okay, it's clear. Come on! Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks on the plane to Afghanistan, guys. Ah, sorry. Mss Nicks isn't answering any more questions. 'K, let's put him on here. Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours. Dude, looks like we're going tooh... Afghanistan. Twenty hours! Alright alright, let's just get the goat back to his home!  We have to find this address. Hey look! There's a taxi! Hello. We need to go...  here. I think so. A-ah, hi. We're from America.  Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? Yu, you sent us this goat? Here. Wu-we don't want it. No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat Oh uh, and here.  Take this American flag as... a gift. Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America. Hey! Hey, open the door! How come they hate America so much? What the hell did we do? Alright.  Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad. What?  Howdy. Cartman, you stupid asshole! You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies! Dude, these people are insane. Hey, what are you guys doing here? Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war. But why? Why does a third of the world hate us? :	 ...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes! ...He's got us there, dude. Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing.  Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all. Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too. Come on, let's go gat to the plane. No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, I didn't smile. Did you go yet? What's he want? Goddamnit Cartman, what?! That isn't funny, Cartman. ...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son. No way! Cartman, where are you going?? Oh boy. Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of tahown. Yeah, you missed them turning around. What? Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's. How the hell should we know? There's these two people with asses where their heads should be. But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical! Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head? Dude, the ass-faces' son is Ben Affleck! Hey, you're laughng, Cartman. Huh? Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse. Hey dude. What the hell was that? I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass. Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype. Book. Later, dude. Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is. Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home. So dude, did Cartman's idea work? Damn! Yeah, haha Your family is rich, dude. Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table. Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie? Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway. What's that? DVD? We don't own a DVD player. Come on, guys. We'll jsut have to find other stuff to do. I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play. I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman! Oh hey, there's Token. Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play? Sure, dude, you're our friend. Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you. Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew. Yeah, I get it for that. Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore. Yeah, so now you're a pussy. Pussaholic. Well that burned a long time. Oh dude, there goes one. What, Butters? Tell him we're busy. Alright, let's go see what he wants. What? A boat? Well WHAT, Cartman? Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?! Stem cells? Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again. The principal? Aw, come on! Wait. What's going on here? Well how sick? ...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right? Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better. ...But... he's our... fu... fufu friend. No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!! Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die! I- I can't, I just can't. I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing. And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT! Just leave me alone! I'm not the one who's leaving, he is! Hey Chef. Bad. Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend? But then, why does God give us anything to start with? I thnk I understand. Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now. Hey, Kenny!  Oh no.  No. But...  I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye. Did he say anything before he went? I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend. What, Cartman? What's happened? This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses? Butters was missing? Damn, dude. Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you. Oh, dude, look!  It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches! Hey Kenny We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! What kind of help? I'll bet you can. Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass. Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight. He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster. You wouldn't be a penisbutt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... Now he's got lots of moneys and girls Marry him? Chef, we need more food. Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed. How do you feel, Butters? Alright, now it's time for phase 2. We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world. Did you bring the camera? That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches. Butters?? What the hell are you doing?? Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?? All prepared for liposuction surgery? Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault. We've gotta hurry this up. He's losing weight. Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home. Dude, bail! Come on, Butters. Time to go. What? ...Kenny would have done it. Alright, it's settled.Come on, Butters. That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared! What?? Wait. Everyone hates Jared now? Awgh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out. No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have ""AIDS"" aids, he has assistants. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides. Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials? Fifteen dowlar? But... Jared got millions! Oh God-damnit Why? Well, so much for our money. He's such a douchebag Yeah, and then what? They're still asleep. What's a Hitler? No, I never have. Smell what? Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess. Uhh no. Stan. Marsh. Dude, I'm just learning. I never said I was. ...pizza...French fries...Frnehc fries...pizza... Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own. Oh no. Heather? ...who are you people?! All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone? Okay. Yeah, prob'ly Fries... fries... Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with. Thanks. Who are you? Seems fine. Don't care. I dunno. Oh God. Gah, let's go you guys. Dude, what the hell is your problem?! I raced you, You won. What??? I'll be there, you queen! Yeah! Dude, I have to! Dude, he's got Heather! I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be? ...Thank you. This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to! That does it! I'm calling the police! Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13. I have to do this, okay? I have to! Pizza... pizza... pizza... Thanks. Where the hell have you guys been?! No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks! Hm, that sounds pretty good. Hey Kenny! Sh be quite, Not-Kenny, the Maury Povish freak show is on. Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize! What disease should we say? What? This is gonna be so funny! We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about? It has to be you, Butters. Think about it. Kenny woulda done it. Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand. Where's you get the balls from? Wow! All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I That's your flight, Butters. Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV. Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! Here he comes. But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't! Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you? Yeah, they wanted to find you bad. I- told them where to find you. Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over. Wiat a minute. Veal is... little baby cows?? Yeah, I wouldn't have. Tomorrow morning?  Dude, we gotta help them. Pst, Cartman. Cartman, wake up! We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass! So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us! We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together. Damnit Butters, will you shut up?! Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us? Go on, dude it's the only way. Just do it really fast, and we can go. Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on! Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman? Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta. I said that's far enough!  Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose.  There you go. You're free. Run away!  Go! They're gonna murder you. Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You have to get out of here. They aren't leaving. Oh yeah, they're too weak to move. Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back. Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house. I dno't know. We're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  Come on, you guys. We won't have to. Butters said he has something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over. Butters!  Did you bring it? What? Aw crap! That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people! They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die. No! You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the onew who know we were making little baby animals suffer! Kiss my ass! I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing. Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now. Shut up, Cartman. Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman. Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this. This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe. Round one is over. We made it. Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in. Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours. We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf! Wait, what is that?  Dude! See? Now we can hold out for weeks! Wha? Dude, what are you guys doing? You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?! That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again! No, this is exactly what we wanted. Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people. ...I don't believe it. Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! What are they doing here? Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores. No! Hello? Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do? Waht do I say?? Cartman, no! O-ogh... It... did? Pick me up. I... I want to see. We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried! Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas. Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anythng! Alright, here we go. Shelley, we're watching that! Go back! No! Shelley, we have to watch HBC! It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie! But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow. But Shelley, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe. Shelley, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anythng! O-K, deal. Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch. Dude, I'm not going. Stan. Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up? They look fine to me. That's worse! Dude! Dude, the commercials could start any time! Get all the stuff! We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! Hurry! We can't miss the commercials! Huff, huff Aww! AGH!  Wait! Chef just got a new plasma TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on! Yeahyeah, how do you change the channels? We made it! Here they come! I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break. Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon. Oh God-damnit! Come on, we gotta go somewhere else! The bar! They've got a TV at the bar! We made it. But we have to watch the commercials in this show. Come on, we gotta get to a TV! Commercial Break Number Two! I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break. Oh, God, it's horrible! We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go! Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated! Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house! She has to! Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute! What? The last commercial break has to be coming on any second! We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house?? Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! We've made it! Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be?? Wait a minute! Look!  ""The following preview has..."" This is it! This is it! That looks AWEsome! Oh, dude, let's go! I wonder if it all a western? Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunites elsewhere. All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place. So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great. One thing for sure: picking our new freidn isn't gonna be easy. All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck. Okay, next? Yeah,it's not bad. Next? Shut up, fatass! I like it. Okay, let's try this. Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? Oh, this is giving me a headache. You're right. Well now, how about Timmy? He's quiet and he takes direction well. How about Token? That's great. Suckup. Just put it between his eyes. Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time? Oh, hey Butters. Uh oh. Alright, I'll chip in. Ready. Let's see 'em. Are they playing basketball? Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish. What are we gonna do with them? Yeah, that'd be funny. Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened. Oh jeez, change the channel. They found the sea men! It's only a matter of tiime before they find the women, too! We're dead! Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are! Chef, we did something kind of bad. We need you to promise not to tell anybody. We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach So what should we do? This is it. Yeah, stupid. Dude, it's probably in her stomach. What do we do now? Do you see the sea people. Yeah. Aaah! Let's go! The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee. ...and then we put them back in the tank. Okay. Goodnight, Cartman. Oh no, what now? Wow. How did that happen? They've already accomplished so much. Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture. Well, drop them in! That's cool. Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. ...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose? Hm. Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come. Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything. Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue! The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue. That sounds pretty fun. What are they talking about? Um, cool. ...Like ...money? What? What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest every put anything in our butts. We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out. Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt? What? Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth. You've had five, dude! Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth. What? He did. Yeah it does. Yeah. It does. So? Dude, look. Aw, dude, why would they do that? That's gay. Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies? Goddamnit, that pissed me off! Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified! We have to do something. Let's form a club. No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with! Well what's wrong with it? Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. What? Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand people in there! Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats. Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause. Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortuantely we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause? Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference! Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat. ...212, 213, 214 members! Really? That's great. If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films. When did we do dibs for it? Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now? Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? That is our understanding. It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies. Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves. Okay, go. Over here! Aw, really? Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song. So we have to warm his icy heart with a ""hot"" island song Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours. Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it. Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! He's definitely lost it You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it. Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! Yuh, you guys okay. Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world. Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again. Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something? Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us. Ah, hey, Bebe. Uh, we're gonna throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us. Hellafun Cool.  We'll see you later, Bebe. That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. So what you do, see, is wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now- Hoh hoh hoh! ...Wait, what were we doing again? Hey, that's what I wrote about! Hah hah, hah!  Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde. That's such a great paper! Yeah. Uh huh. That would be best. Kyle?? Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out! No! Yeah! Sure thing, Bebe. Yeah.  Where are you guys going? Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo? Hoh! Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together. Is Bebe home? Cartman's? Hoh! Hoh, hoh, hohhh! Hohhh! Hoh, hoh hoh hoh! Hoh hoh hoh!  Hohohoh hoh! Hoh. Hoh? Aaaa-ta.  Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta. Ahta. Ah, ahta! Hoh? Ahta.  Ahta. Ahah Ahta? Friend. Ahta. Ahta! Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs. Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions. I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us. I hope this movie doesn't suck ass. Child Tracker? ...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker! I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?! Huh? But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun. I'm not done with my pizza. Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker. But why do I have to leave? Where are we supposed to go? Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid. Bi ologad bag, big nan dastai. Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude. Uh huh, Stan Marsh. Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub?? Because our names were called on the commercial last night! We're gotta find that ticket! You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. Where's Kenny?? Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure. Did you get it? Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there! I can't see. It wa a trick! Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot! We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not goona have our shopping spree. It's over! Cartman, come on! Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny! We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven. Because we wanna see Kenny again. Mr. Garrison threw away his car? Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it! Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Uh, we ran out of stuff.  We ran out of stuff to build theh ladder with. We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood. No. Hello?? Kenny?? God?? No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off. What?? Hey Kenny. Dude, what the hell is wrong with you?? Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree. No, we have to see Kenny! Cremated? What's that? Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny! Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree! You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. Where?? Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow. Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?! Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels... Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body. Dude, come back here! You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters? Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors! How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog? Good job, wizard. My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings. The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you. Woww. We have come to reclaim the one tape! No, we have to return it! Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too. Nothing.  Hey kid! Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents! There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body! Oh crap, dude! Ogh. Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders. We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon. Yes, but this is not a-  Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too. Uh well wait, what'd you see? What do we do with it? I will take it!  I will walk to the video store. No no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember? True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store. Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about. Jimmy didn't stop them! Just get across the river! They're coming! Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river. This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in! Where?! Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass! Closed?? Wait. A drop box.  Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in! They're coming! Uh oh. Oh hey guys, uh. We were just about to come home. We had to return the video. ...Wwow. Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body. No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher. Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay. Yeah, I have to remember that. I guess. Oh, no, noo, no no no no. Chef, we're intolerant. Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him. Are we homophobes now? N-no? We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos! Tolerance camp? Kyle.  Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures. The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you! Butters! Jesus... we have to get out of here. Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die. Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago. No, that's Kenny. That's Cartman. Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings poeple on and talks to their dead relatives. Awesome! Uh, over here please? We told you that. No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body. Heh hey wait a minute dude. He seemed better on TV? Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? We don't get to go to Scotland? Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso. That's us. Come on. Huh? Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually. Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. What?? Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap! Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please. I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick. Jesus Christ. Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up. Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real. Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life. Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called ""intuition."" Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun. No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real. No dude, you're a douche. Then you're a stupid douche I'm nine years old. You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Son of a bitch. Kyle! Kyle! Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche. Kyle, you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called ""cold reading."" They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them. No, he's not. Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you? Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay? Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you. Does this month, November, hold a special significance? Right, because he's saying, ""Tell her 'Happy Brithday.'"" See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man. I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying ""He wishes you a Happy Birthday."" Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He saying ""the money. Stop worrying about the money."" No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about. What?! No wait. Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully. This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay? They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter. No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, ""Peter was your husband?"" Stop it! I didn't do anything! I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, ""They want me to acknowledge Peter."" That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, ""I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely"" Okay. Let's back up.  Not literally! Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience. Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead! No, I don't think either of us can. I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever! Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche! Fine, douche! No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience. You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but thnk about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole?  We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche. Yeah. There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself. No, it can't be. Oh, dude! Now do you people believe me? What's going on? So throw it away. You guys, those commercials are just exaggerations. It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you. Fine, I will.  There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal. Aw, come on, Mom. It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake! Who the fuck is is, Mom and Dad? I'm me from the past? Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana! What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! Stop it! No! Quit it! Hey guys. This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32. Shut up, Cartman! God-damnit! Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters. I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him. I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room! Yeah, it's like everything I do, he... Wait a minute, what'd you say? Dude, how long has your future self been around? Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future?? Where is he now? Liver medicine? Alright, where is that sonofabitch's wallet?! Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? Here it is.  It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet? Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. Here it is. Motivation Corp. Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. What the hell is going on here? I can't believe it! It's all a scam! They've all been lying to us this whole time! Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated! They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors! It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it! Who's that? What? We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that! ...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care. But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! No, we gotta run away somewhere warm. Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them? Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow? Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you. That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents! Fine, then you can come with me. I guess this is it. Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents? Cartman?? What the hell are you doing here?! God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business! How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?! Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol. How much is this going to cost us? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah! That's not neato, that sucks. You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized! Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me! Dude! No, that's too extreme! Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! Hey future self. You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about? You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep? You must know what I'm talking about. Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole futre self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across. What? Hide and go seek, huh?! I don't believe that he's my future self! No, I actually have a way to be sure. I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear. But I have to know for sure. Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it. Yes? AAAH! That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake. Butters! Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here. Butters, we're running away! Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change! Huh? Get the fuck out of here. Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me! I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe! I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning. Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby. Cartman, why are you doing this? Wuh, that smells. Uh, I don't really wanna get on there. I don't know. Awww! God, it took forever! Hang on, Santa! Wny would Iraqis do that? Why? Oh no. Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us! I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead. Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq! We're here. Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. Oh my God. The Iraqis killed Jesus. Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh... RPG, four o'clock! We brought Christmas to Iraq! Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas. Oh, hey Kenny. Dude, sweet! Dude! Visitors! That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors! Visitors are real. They...  Wait a minute. This has all happened before. No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that? I remember this whole thing.  Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream. What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef? Chef, we're in a repeat. It all started when Cartman got an anal probe. You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes. Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times. You all right? Where to now, Chef? What? Go on. Oh, nice going, Cartman! We wanted to see an alien planet or something. What do we do??? Let's go! What is that? Chef! End of the road! It's the police! Chef!! Uh.  Wugh. You guys. Wake up! We're in the alien ship. Guys. Look. My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space. Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy. Dad? Yeah, that's like that stupid movie, Contact. Okay okay, take the form of something else! Nno, that's stupid too. No! I like it. You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass? Television? Our planet is just a reality-TV show? Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment! Oh shit, did we do that? Wait! Wait, they they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads! Please, take us to them! Please! Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads? Uh, Earth? Look, we just want to talk to you about the show. But sirs, we think our show is just getting good.  I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other. Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us. Dude, we're trying to save our planet here?! Sirs, uh, if you'll just let- Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong. No, wait. We won't tell anybody, if you don't cancel our show! I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent. Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders. Look, dude. Christopher Reeve, dude. Yeah dude, not cool. Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one. Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy. That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one. Cartman, trust me.  We don't want any part in this one. Stay clear, guys, stay clear. Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads. See? Mrs. Dreible thinks she's so cool! Like what? Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore! D'you think that's enough? Okay. Is this the right house? Kyle, we all agreed to do this! Let's go, Kyle! Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together. We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up. Yes, dude! Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody. What about him? Butters. So what should we do? ... Dude, we're not killing Kyle! Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright? Cartman, what are you doing? You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed! They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station. We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true? Butters? He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it. It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad.  I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess. Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.  And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! What is it, Cartmam? Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final. You, you do? How? Wugh! Two weeks of this! Let's go see a movie! Uh... war? Yeah.  War is not my voice. You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us! No, you just have to study. Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study! How?! Cartman? Oh no... Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea. Aww crap. I gues we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys! Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress- Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war. Oh, no, nononono. Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision- Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww.  Awww, now we lost two in our study group! Uh, we didn't do it. Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Dalight Saving, so we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then- He does? Can't be Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand?  Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off! What are you gloating about? What's the matter? What's she doing? I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it. Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make [us feal dumb? Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you. All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything. It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it. Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need to be solved, for a dollar? Have you reported this to any other authorities? We're on the case. Detective McCormick found something interesting. You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody. His plan was to use a hammer. Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head. The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub. Just the news. Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady. Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar! Yes it is! All right, Sarah, come over here.  Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny. You got it, Ken? Put that away, dude! Right, so it's possible that the theif sat out in that tree.  He would have watched Sarah with the doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife.  The pain gave him sick pleasure. Hey, kid, what are you doing? Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation! Aw crap! Son of a bitch stupid FBI! No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that doll before thos FBI guys do. We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning. They've gotten really good at this good cop-bad cop thing. It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your weiner until white stuff comes out. Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house! Okay, okay. Ready? Break the door down! South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll! I don't know. Dude, we just can't tell on them. Jesus! They're gonna kill her! Hey, you buttholes can't play FBI here! We're gonna charge the front door and go get it. Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us! We go get the doll ourselves. That's right.  But they didn't say anything about going in the back. Bang bang bang! I got you, Fosse! Did so! We got it. Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home? We do what we can, sir. Sure. I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama. Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework? Damn. Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the- We just wanna be junior detectives. It'll get better, guys. Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time to it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners? I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle? You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. See you guys at school tomorrow. Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff. No thanks. Thanks. ...I think I have a better idea. Yes, I have a suit that needs to be dry-cleaned. And pressed, please. Wow, dude. Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here. We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team! We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars! We need somethng that'll get us money tomorrow! Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters! Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars! No! I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle! Look, we, we've got nothing to lose. Dad.  Good luck. Come on! Come on! Theh, they had it! They freakin' had it! You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some. A winning streak??!! You played one game!!!! What??? You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans! Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money! Come on, you guys! This is our town! We can stay. And fight. Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now!  Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys! No! We won't let you destroy our town! Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chilis. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life. This land is not for sale. It's all right, dad. She's hanging in there.  Here, drink some beer. You're gonna be all right. No, Dad, NO. What can I do? Cure SARS? Aw, Jesus! Hey, my name's Stan, and I was- Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS? An inward journey? That sounds kind of gay. Ah! Oh, dude! Dad! Dad! Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS.  Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite. Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night. So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy come on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top. I know! Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll. You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend. Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all?? Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover! Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look! All right. Let's work it!  What the...? Hey Craig. These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us! Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are! We're metrosexual!! Dude! W-what are you doing? We're not straight! You're straight! Wow, is that from Origins? Well, what can we do about it? What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore. Yeah. Wait, what? Hey, what's goin' on? Wow, we look great! You'd better shut up, Craig. It is not! Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can outdress you! Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us? Yeah. It's cool, holmes. Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our band. Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. See what? I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band! Hey dude. No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet! You got a computer? See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer! Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too. What the hell is that? We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again! Boy, I'll say! Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice. Oh yeah. It is?? Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity. What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his. Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough. Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy! I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band. What?? Is this for real?? This is for real! Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert. So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman. Are you- gonna pay 'im? I thought albums win either gold or platinum. Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive? But they kill people. I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die. What is that? I think so. What is he saying? Oh Jesus! Dad, I'm scared. I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore! Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving. Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa. What's that? The American Association of Retired Persons. Hey Dad. Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them? No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it? All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here  and here . The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office. Yeah, I remember hearing about that. All right! We did it! ...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in. Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault! Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it. And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine. Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that. What's Casa Bonita? Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us. Yeah, it's kinda weird. Yeah. Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there. Really? Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do. I knew he'd turn up. Cartman, stop it! Yeah, screw that kid! Wull, maybe he won't fight. All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass. No. I'm... I'm gonna kick your ass. I'm gonna kick your ass...  bitch. Huh? Dude, stop it. Shut up, Butters! I'm...  going over to his house for dinenr tonight. He's a really nice kid. What's that? No. The... Book of Mormon? What's that? Who's Joseph Smith? No! What happened then? No, I was supposed to be home at eight. ...Hello? Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith? The guy who spoke to God and Jesus. That's not what the Harrisons said. The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right. They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink? But that's just you and your friends. Mr. Harrison said that I should be followng Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is. Yeah. So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass? See? That's what happened to me! That's what they made me think, too! Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented. What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance. Wow, you made this? Un, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh... Uh, no. I've got a lot to do. Yyeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy. What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground? Yeah, but... how? Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat? It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri. But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa. Hey Gary. Dad! Yeah. ...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet? No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind? No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translatios were hidden! I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad! Oh, stop it!  That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad! I'm not hanging around that kid anymore. You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me. Oh brother. I don't? Huh, Jesus Christ! Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one. ...Woops. Mom...  Dad, it was just a- Hwat?? Yeah, what's the problem? Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand. Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice. Huh? Yeah, maybe you're right. What are you doing, Cartman? Well, get away from us then. Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own! Daaaad! Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us. Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember? Oh all right. Why? So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks. Yup. It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do! All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third ""set hut!"" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen. Football. Okay. 23!  Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! What? Oh whoa, wait a minute.  What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks. Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me? 'Cause I need to know why she broke up. Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her? What? That's no answer!  Go tell her to be more direct with me. Kyle, this is my life.  Jimmy! Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me? Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her, tell her...  she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me. She's a continuing source of inspiration to me. Well? Over?  Jesus... ...Go away. Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone? You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken... Can we go, please? No, dude, I feel worse! Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wnedy, I could be alone my whole life! I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all thealking for me. It's time I took control! Something I should have done a long time ago. Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now!  All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her! Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of? I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else. There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life. Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids. But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living? All right, so how do I join you? ...'K. Yeah.  STAN The pain is everlasting. They're not? Well I don't drink coffee. Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul. So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so. What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token? Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain? ...conformist. Butters? What's the matter with you? Huh? But you just got dumped No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all. He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home. Hey, can I join in? Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action. Sure dude. Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure? Dude, Cartman. Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way. Dad, don't get carried away. Whoa whoa, Cartman. Cartman, calm down! It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined. Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures. No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not? What's going on?? Do something, Kyle! Look out! You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore. All right dude, let's get the hell out of here! I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses. Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister. What? What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada. Oh no! And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure. Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! What is that? Oh my God, look!  Martial arts weapons from the Far East. Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas. Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.  I'll get the tonfas.  Those are so sweet. Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons. We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year. Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked. Kiya! Kiya! With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Sharohachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like. What's your ninja name, Kenny? All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world! Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go. All right, this is it. Ninja positions!  Hello, Craig! We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff. Hyeah, ""they're not that cool."" These are real authentic weapons from the Far East. Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do. Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state! Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys.  We have a lot of work to do. Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction. Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with! Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers! I dunno. Craig, is that you? Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa Takanawa!  Hey kid, that knocks you down. Yeah huh, I got you! Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star! It's Butters. Oh my God!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye! Ssh sshhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really. Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay! Dude, shut up! What?? Just stay still, Butters. God-damnit! We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait what about the veterinarian? He's really old and and goin blind. We might pass him off as our pet. All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened. All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town. Okay, it's clear. Oh shit, somebody's coming! Where'd you get those? Uh not now, Craig, we we have to be going. Guys, we're we're really not playing, okay? We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hey wait wait WAIT wait!  Wait.  Hold on a second. Where's Butters? Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him! No dude, you gotta help us find him! Butters! Butters! Bad. Nnothing, just, playing. Butters! What? Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back. It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them. All right, the county fair's still open! We have come to return the weapons we purchased. What is it, Craig? Come on, Ninjas! Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there. Good luck, Bulrog. Ohhh Jesus. What? Just run with it, dude. Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy. Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on. So? That's really, really terrible, dude. Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence initiated. Things seem pretty quiet. Oh God, here we go again. That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here. Look at that, dude. The Passion has made almost 400 milliion dollars at the box office now. Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to ge see it too. Dude. That movie sucked. How can they even call that a movie? That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back. Hey, we want our money back. That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars. That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film! You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours! We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back! W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson? Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny! Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go.  Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damnit, no phone number! Oh wait! ""For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.."" Okay, okay, wait, here we go. Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion Nonono, no, we want our money back. We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him? Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back! Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass! I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me! Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?! Wait a minute. Cartman?! Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu! We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!  This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball! Thank you.  This must be the place. Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded. Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please? Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money. Tor-torture you? We don't want to torture you. Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you? Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy! Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!  Wait! There's his wallet! Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny?? All right, let's get the hell out of here! Run, dude, run! Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson. But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters. Oh, you've got to be shittin' me. Goddamn, that guy's crazy.  Hey dude, you've gotta speed up. Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster. I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna- Yeah. I told you that! He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it. He's kookoo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind. It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked! No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results. Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one. Chef, we just got served. Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess- Some, kids from Orange County. No. But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'. But Dad- Yeah, let's go race it right now. What? I thought I was supposed to! But why?? I, I don't know. He seems all right. Yeahh I'm I'm right here, Dad. Okay, good. God damnit! Hey guys. Uh. You guys know how to dance, right? Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe? Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served. Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it? Great! All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance. The arcade? Dude, he's incredible. Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe? Yeah. Dude, we need you. It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us. All right, that's three! Huh? Oh yeah.  Wait a minute. I know just where to go! Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick. And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County. So you'll do it? All right, we just need one more person! What? The state tap champion is from here? Who? Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You mean... Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe. It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago. But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska. We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion. Damnit, where are we gonna get our fifth member? A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talneted person in South Park. All right, so you're sure he can dance? Ih ih Is that the only song he'll dance to? My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe. Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer. We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we? Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like- I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you. Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country. Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that. Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant. And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward. But that isn't the point, Butters! The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying ""Haha! I'm better than you!"" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Leggos until you're an old man. Fine.  But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies. What? What happened?? Aw, what do we do, Chef?? Butters! Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot? Why? Why? Uh yeah, Butters, he's real cool. What's that you're wearing? Whoa. Dude, no way. Dude, are these all your toys? Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something. Hey you guys! You guys!  You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons! I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons. Yeah. It's just a dad and his son. Fine Mom. No, my parents are. What? Kyle? Mr. Jefferson- Awww!  It's 1:30 in the morning! Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow! He just showed up here. Jesus Christ! I know. He's here. No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home. Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now! Haaa! Yeah. A really bad dream.  Oh Jesus! You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak! Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there. Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us. Mr. Jefferson, ih it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood Stop, you fucking lunatic!! You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe. Blanket, you in here? All right dude, get in his bed. Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something. Go go RUUN! Oh Jesus! Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Run Blanket Run! Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages? Cartman, just keep your mouth shut. Whoa. Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future! Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em. Night, Mom.  Wow, two people from the future. How cool. Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today? All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. Son of a bitch! It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too!  Oh, they took our jobs!! I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' tuh- Who is that? Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs! Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away. I wanted my job! Timecist? People from the future. Right, got it. That's right! Can you speak in present-day English please? Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries. No, a double cheeseburger and fries! What?! I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger! No, it's not a chicken sandwich!  I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks! Aw-awwww. Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you? They took yer jarb!! I I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us. They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better. I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work. We're doing it! Dude, wait wait ho, hold on. Wait a second.  This is gay. Okay, sorry, my bad, e-everyone back in the pile. Buh, Mr. Garrision, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win! This is bullcrap, dude! Dude, I really don't care. Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot? I'm not voting! I just think this whole thing is stupid! It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point. Mom, a-I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care. Puff Daddy? I... ""Vote or Die""?  What the hell does that even mean?! AAAAH!! Okay. I'll vote. I guess... Okay. I'm voting. Yeah, I know. I thoght I was supposed to make my own decision. Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy! Oh forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it! The whole thing is a joke! B-bani-banishment? Ya... you're all joking, right? I'm not voting! Dad, isn't this a little extreme? Hello? Oh thank God. Awww! What about me? I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it. Wow, you guys really love animals. I'll live with you. He said I can stay Ahh no thanks, that's okay. I do love animals, just ...nnot like you guys do. I can't. I was banished for not voting. I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. I guess... I guess you're right. AAAAAH! AAAAH!! I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have. Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter! ...What? It's time for what? Dad, how come Wall*Mart is able to sell everything so cheap? Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores. Butters? Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall*Mart is doing to our town. Dad?  Jesus Christ, Dad. Dad?? Dad, oh my God! What? D-dad, are are you dying? But you-your face! Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall*Mart anymore. Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their- But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at- Dad! Dad, what are you doing?! Dad, you're a geologist! Where are they? Three tickets to Bentonville, Arkansas, please. Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave. Dude, come on! Dude, we have to go! Well hurry up if you're coming, Cartman! Goddamn that took a long time. Where's he? There has to be a way! Why don't you guys just destroy the heart? No, dude, don't! Save it, Grandpa! Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall*Mart. One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department. What?! Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back! Is that the right way, Dad? Dad??  Dad! Come on, Dad! No, dad! We need your keys! There! The television department! You? We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you. Mr. I'm asking the question. Stan Marsh. Now, where's the heart? It's a mirror. Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart. We'd better get out of here. Hey, come on! We've gotta get out! Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now! RIGHT NOW, GODDAMNIT! Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall. Yeah. He just got paroled. What the hell are we gonna do?? Dude, let's play Fireman. Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a i>real fire. Then we'll be heroes! Start one. Then we're gonna put it out. Yeah yeah, we play Fireman all the time. Wow, cool! Woowoowoowoo, Clang clang clang clang clang!  Come on, firemen! Put out the fire! Put it out, put it out! Dude, we are in so much trouble! That's true. No! Yeah, who cares? Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released. Sshhh, here comes Ms. Claridge now. Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge? Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection. I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on! Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders. We've come to... ask you for help. Yeah. WHAT?? Dude, weak! NO! You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class. But mom, my teacher will- But Mo-o-o- This is hopeless! That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs! No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of. All right, fine. Escuse me! We, we got it. Dude, are we gonna be like that someday? Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing? Ms. Claridge? Dude, what happened? What's that? We're dead. Trent knows we send the sixth-graders after him. No, no, we've just gotta find better help. There is... one person. Shelley? Shelley, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other. Shelley  Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left. Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault. We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us! Admit it was our fault? Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-someting to tell you. See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our weiners a lot, and one game we played was ""Fierman."" Trent, look: We've realized our mistake! What is that? Yeah, who cares? Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now that's traditionally a uh, a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots, and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah ah one fantastic lunch. Eric? And we're cut! Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet. ...Craig's show?? But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV! Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work. Hey look, Craig just walked in. Your idea took about this much thought, Craig! Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better! Come on, guys! All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show. Yeah, Sexy Action, that's good. We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders... Good! All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories! Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused. Then let's do Token's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade. No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want. I knew we could do it! Craig's new show? Hey wha-b-but we gave it our best. I don't believe it. Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever! Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas? Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on!  How about we do a show with us... ughhh. Crab people? Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people. We're hopelessly stuck, completely out of ideas. Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine. I guess we'll just take all of 'em. It's... 's the greatest show of all time. You guys. You guys, wake up! We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything. You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long. No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now.  I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine! They're doing it in the hallways! Behind the school! Even in the girls' bathroom! We showed the shocking footage to the principal! The cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring Middle Park Elementary. But they took action: ridded their entire town of cough medicine, and what we see now is a happier school, 100% cough medicine-free. Gee, what a concidence. Nobody has any ideas? Oh, thank God. Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman. It's not gonna work; just come down from there. Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof. He's not gonna do it. Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea! Butters, Goddamnit. Call an ambulance. What the hell? It's... nice. Okay, okay. Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home. Wugh. Oh, whatta? What time is it! You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow. ...What? All right, I'm going now Go away! Shoo! Again? Goddamnit, this is fucking ridiculous! Grrr. Grrr! Come on out!  Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr! Rawrrrrr! Hokay, there. I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? Aw. Awww! It's dead. I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore. Wait, wha-what? Waiwait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior! But I thought you meant the Son of God! Ugh. Uuugh! No nonono. Leave me aLONE!! All right all right all right!! God!! I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian! No!! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist!  I came here to put a stop to all this! Right, whatever.  I'm taking down the manger I built.  Ah!  Aaaah!!  Aagh! Aaaahh!  AAAAAAAH!! AAAAAAAH!! Oh yeah. Hello? Anybody in there? Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil. I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion! Well, you're mountain lions. There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby. What?! No, he didn't. No, he didn't! No, he didn't!! Aw Goddamnit! I don't know, I, I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it'd ridiculous. This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point. Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born? Too late? The hell is that?? It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass! That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?! I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I I tried to stop them! Dude, what the? Come on, dude. What? Kyle?? Dude!! No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner. Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the earth. Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil. No Santa, don't! The lion cubs! I took them to see how abortions are done. Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast! Yeah. Yeah, there is. Ogh, good. Dude, don't be nervous. You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure. Good luck. Dude, you were awesome, Kyle.  Look, y-you gave it your best shot, right? That's all you could do. Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball. Wha-a-a negroplasty?? Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea? What? Jesus Christ, dude! Dude, is Kyle's- dad a- dolphin? Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison. What?! But you made him into a basketball player. Oh Jesus, he's about to play! Kyle, NO! Yeah, that's basically it. All right.  'Scuse me.  Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice? Who are the corporations? Are you serious?? We never heard that. Well... Well what do we do? Sign, sign everywhere. Sign Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fatcats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read. Right, so how do we get back at them? NO! Yeah! So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations? You mean like a baker and a cop? All right, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage! Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing? It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something? Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should lookt at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long? Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here. What?? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap? Dad! Token sings? Two hundred dollars. Wow, two hundred dollars. Can you imagine? Yeah. We're too smart to be talented. Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does. He's looking at the sign. All right. It's genius. Oohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man. You guys, we're gonna lose our client. Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can. This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie. Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us! Oh, you're interested in hiring our client? You were awesome, Token! This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now. Uh excuse me, Token already has representation. So unfair... so unfair. Huh? You were looking for a talent agent? And what does she do? Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us. Yeah! Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents. Everything's fine, yeah, but we're supposed to arrive in Los Angeles in about four hours. Listen, does your wife ever eat? Or anything? Uhh, all right. We'll call you after she goes on TV. Uh sure, here she is.  Okay, finarry everything rookin' up for me and my family.  Welcome to Shitty Wok, take your order prease?  Aw crap, Chinese Mafia!  Aaaaahh! There it is! American Idol constestants! Ah our client has an audition to this show. Oh no, nonono, come on!  Excuse me, ma'am. No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing. We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday! We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away! All right, our client will do it! What's ""The Contender""? Brint it on Wing! Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado? Oh, thanks. You do?? We won't! You guys, you guys! Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars! Yeah! Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ...where's Wing? ...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again. Oh no!  Hey! That's our client! Two four nine all right, this is the place. Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now! You tell 'em, Kyle! Jesus, they really want Wing as their client! No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents! We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way! You bastards! Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are! Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of. Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities. It's a lousy business. I quit. I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people. It's a game called ""Heaven versus Hell."" Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan.  Dude, you see what Kenny got? Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at. Are we in trouble or something? Oh wow... Please what? What? Kenny?? Dude, how's you do that?? Yeah, the lawyer lost that page. Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he he's gonna die for sure! Yeah! Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny. Don't kill Kenny! Don't kill Kenny! Well, what does it say? Oooo. You mean, Cartman's side is right? Aw Jesus, not again. Yes! It's over! It's over! We can start having fun again! We did it! We did it! ... What? No... NOOO!! Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad. I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-deatn elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over. I know we can lose if we try. Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know. Hundred bucks, no big whoop. Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh,  here's a list of all the pitches I'm gonna throw, in order. Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?! Damnit! No! Goddamnit! Aw spit! Oh no. No, no, no! Dad? Dad, we need to talk. Goddamnit. I don't suppose you guys want to win this game. Gay. Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win. Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance. Wow, he IS great at sucking. Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our tean suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking. This can't get any worse. Disqualified?  Fight! Keep fighting! Come on, Dad! Get up! Mom! I want a breast! But Mom, we've been waiting for hours! All right. Okay, this is everything, mom. Oh boy!  Cartman, you ate the skin off of every piece of chicken! I can't believe that fat asshole! Well this time he's gone too far! Why do we even hang out with him, anyway? Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time! All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him. I think I have extra. Here you go. Cartman isn't our friend anymore. Who was that? Dude, he did that to me this morning. Yeah, we know better than to think that. Cartman? Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did. Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow. He's what?? A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall?  Maybe we should do the talent show. Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They're giving away a hundred dollar first prize for the talent show. Woof."

Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park! Yeah, Yeah, whatever, but the Mayor just called and asked ME to sing at the ceremony! Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful, sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation. Well, THREE times bigger than Frank Gifford's anyway. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. You know... Kathie-Lee, you are a very special woman... I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler- Moore way... Or special in a extra value meal at Happy Burger way... No no no no- I mean SPECIAL... Like... The song of a hummingbird as it gets ready to... to find that female hummingbird, and -- make sweet love to it -- all night long. Just two hummingbirds moanin' and groanin' and letting their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy... (Singing) Ooh Kathie Lee How I'd love to lay you down And lick every inch of your body with my tongue. Kathie Lee, you're my sexual fantasy. How 'bout you and me? (Still singing) Make sweet love..... God bless you Kathie Lee!! But you see, Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury Steak in our public schools... What's next? Meat Loaf? Mayor! Some of the school children are up camping on that mountain RIGHT NOW! C'mon everybody, You got to help the children! That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pigcrap I have ever seen. Oh, no! LOOK! That's Scuzzlebutt! (Singing) Ooh, baby, every time that we kiss HOT LAVA! And every time we make love - That's lava, HOT LAVA! Lava so hot it makes me sweat, Lava so warm and red and wet - Lava ! Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited, nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against Middle Park -- -- But just remember what I taught you: That football is like making love to a really beautiful women; You can't always score, but when you do it makes all the trying worth while. Now let's start practice! Yes, Pip, what is it? I know, Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody. Yes, Pip, I'm afraid it does. Sorry, son, now get your ass in there. HIKE THE DAMN BALL!! Huh? Oh, fine, fine. Elementary school alumni? I don't know? What's the spread? Hmmm... I don't think we have a chance. Great pass, Stan! Okay, that was a good practice children, we'll see you here again tomorrow. Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You've got to hold your football like you would hold your lover. Gently, yet firmly. You want to be both nurturing and clinging at the same time... Oh yeah... just like making sweet love to the football... Be naughty with the football -- (singing) Spank it, ever so gently. Just.. Spank it! Spank it! Spank the football, Spank it. Huh? Oh... Sorry, children... Let's run some plays. No, Pip we still don't have a helmet for you. That wouldn't be very fair to the other children now would it. What's the matter, Stan? You seem down. Well, you know what they say; you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks. Say what? You of all people should be sympathetic. Well you're gay aren't you? Well you sure do act like it. (nervously checking his watch) Come on, Stan... No, Pip, I'm sorry. You're gonna have to quaterback, Kyle. Well it's a little late for that bullcrap now. (Shouting) What's the matter?! Come on, Kyle, we'll get a delay of game penalty! HIKE THE BALL!! Hey, come on, that was roughing!! ...At least let us scrape him off the field!! Where the hell of you been, Stan? Just get in there, boy! Hello there, children. How're you doing? Why bad? Aw, of course they wont splice children. Haven't you ever heard that song by Loverboy. ""Da'n Do-A, Pig and Elephant D-N-A Just Won't Splice. A pig-elephant? Say, now that's a not a bad idea. Imagine, a pint-sized elephant that you could keep in the house... Children, we could make a fortune with this! But forget all that genetic engineerwhoosa-fudge... If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweet love. Sure they would... But you're gonna have to get 'em in the mood. Do what I do... get 'em good and drunk. Hello children. I thought I'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going. Oh, children. You can't just stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant and expect them to do the mattress mambo. You need to set the mood. Let me show you boys what I'm talking about. (singing) Tonight is right for love, you know. I wanna touch you where the lights don't go -- Tonight is right for love, love gravy. Expressing love so sweet, I wanna keep you burning like a dog in heat. Tonight is right for love, love gravy. Ladies and gentlemen Mr. Elton John... Thank you Elton... Tonight is right for love, love gravy. Now children, gather 'round and watch the wonders of life, the beauty of mother nature. Hmmm, now I know how all those white women must have felt. Oh, they will. But it's gonna be one ugly sight! Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children. Uh oh! Here we go! (very sympathetic) Yeah, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig, or a big fat elephant. Well, boys, we might not know that for a couple of days. Hey, you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill. Hello there, children! How's it going? Why bad? You can't kill my grandpa, Stan, he's already passed on. No I don't think that's okay, Stan. In fact I think that's illegal. I don't want to touch that with a forty-foot pole. Hello children! What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that? Elvis? I'm Evil Knieval! Why the hell would I dress up like Elvis? Hello, children. AHH!! AGH!! Damn, Johnson, what the hell's gotten into you? Get the hell out of here, Johnson! I don't want no God damn pink eye! Pink eye my ass! I've seen this kind of thing before... Doctor! No, Doctor! I've seen this type of thing before... This ain't no pink eye... It's THE LIVING DEAD! Think about it! Dead people getting up and walking around... and Tina Yothers comes to town! Coincidence? Oh I don't think so! Damnit! Don't you see? These people have been Zombified! They got no heartbeat, no feeling... I'll show you. Oh. Sorry. But my point is that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here! Doctor, who was the first person to come in here with the sickness? AAGHHH!!!! Mayor, we've got a BIG problem -- Actually, I... I don't really give a crap. We've got to do something about THE LIVING DEAD! No, dammit! I'm talking about the Zombies that have taken over South Park! Aw, to hell with you both! GET OFF MY PROPERTY YOU BRAIN EATIN' ZOMBIE BASTARDS!! Oh, sorry children, I thought you were one of them! Dammit boy, what the hell are you doing dressed up like that? Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see you. Now get in here before those Zombies get you! Zombies, children! South Park is overrun with THE LIVING DEAD! Haven't you noticed anything strange lately? Don't you children see? Kenny's turned into a zombie, along with everyone else in town! I'm working on it, children. The Doctor said the first people he treated were the Mortician and his Assistant. Now, I've got a hunch we'll get to the bottom of this at... THE MORGUE! Just look for anything suspicious. (grabbing magazine) You better let me take that, Kyle. Uh oh... We gotta call this hotline number children!! LOOK OUT, CHILDREN!!! (Singing) I'm gonna make love, even when I'm dead. My body might get cold, but it's always hot in my bed! Make love, don't you be afraid. Just because my heart ain't beating don't mean you wont get laid. Ooooohhhh! You did it, children! Hello there, children! How's it going? Why bad? Oh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song... (Singing) We're all special, in our own way Everybody's different but that's okay 'Cause even though we might have different color skin, different points of views, be tall or thin -- It doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman and touch your silky skin -- Put my love deep inside you where no man has ever been -- Rub your legs, caress your thighs and.... What were we talking about again? Ooh, that is one futched up little cracker!!!! (Shouting) We've got to do something, children! He's tearing my cafeteria apart!! (To the pretty women) Come over here if you're scared, womens! I'll protect you! Not, you dammit! Ooh, crap. Oh, oh... I can't... I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again. Okay, but I'm just gonna tap you, alright? Oh, God in Heaven!! What have I done?!? Yup, here's your present, children. Well, nice party, see you later. I know, but the fight is starting! Mmmm, that's my favorite kind of chili. Come on, children!! We can still catch the end of the fight!!! Jesus, we're sorry... Can you ever forgive us? Yeah, well let's get it over with. This place gives me the Bubujeebies. Uhh... I see an extreme close up of Vanessa Redgrave's private parts. Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like Turkey DNA. What does it mean? Oh Fudge!! (Pause) Aah, lemme' see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again... It's true, Mayor! those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!! WHOA!! YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS YOU BASTARDS!!! What the...? (Into the microphone) Gather 'round everybody, and listen good! Go to your homes and arm your... (looking at Monkey Boy) What the hell are you supposed to be anyway? No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything. Oh alright. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry! We're not gonna let our thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys! Today you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us!! These fudged up turkeys from the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take our FREEDOM!!! Stay close, children! We've saved Thanksgiving! Every turkey dies. Not every turkey truly lives. (We've all heard this before) Yeah, yeah, yeah...... I'm gonna lay you down by the yule log I'm gonna love you right Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls And silent your night... You'll hear the herald angels sing when I'm sliding off your bra. I Just can't wait to jingle your bells and Fa La La your La! Baby it's Christmas!! Say, where's Kyle? What? Why? Christmas Poo? You mean Mr. Hankey? Well, you can believe in him now. Howdy Ho, Mr. Hankey. I'm glad your here Mr. Hankey, the whole town is about to kill each other. Hello there, children. What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher? Is she like, Vanessa Williams beautiful or Toni Braxton Beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? Or is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rodgers beautiful? WWOOH!!! I gotta meet this woman!! That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other... That's right! That's okay, you know what they say about women with a mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it... Oh, hello! (Suavely) I'm Chef... I just, uh... I stopped by 'cause little Kyle forgot his laundry detergent on the playground. Shh! Crazy crackers are always leaving their detergent all over the place. What was your name again? Well, I'm sure there's no substitute for you. (Singing) Nobody could take your place No way they could match your face 'no, you got it goin on in a way so clear... I just wanna buy you a beer-or maybe tonight at seven thirty or something I could come by and pick you up in my car... (No Substitute) No substitute for you, (No substitute) No baby there's... (No substitute) for you girl (No substitute) for you now. You know that it's true, (No substitute) There's just no substitute for you. If we can have dinner tonight. (Sad) Hello there, children. Not too good. No, no! She's not like that. You see... How do I put this... Children, Ms. Ellen doesn't exactly play for the right team. In other words, children... She's not a member of the heterosexual persuasion. Don't you understand? She's a lesbian! You boys don't know what a lesbian is? Uhh, that's okay. Uhh... Look, all you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a lesbian, and that means she only likes OTHER lesbians. Now, move along, children. You're holding up the line. (RapSinging) Gimme a little bit of that pepper. Gimme a little bit of that salt. Put it in the skillet and cook it- Can I help -- Hey, you're that movie critic guy on TV! Well I'll be a teenage girl backstage at an Aerosmith concert! Leonard Maltin in MY cafeteria! I'm Chef. Barbara Streisand? You mean like, THE Barbara Streisand? No! Not since Yentl! Too late for what? Why do you care? I guess he's not home, Leonard Maltin. Now, come on, man! What is this all about?! Hmmm... Oh... Uh, well, I always heard that Mrs. Streisand had her own four million dollar condominium up near the ski slope. I don't know, it was just a rumor! It was just a rumor... A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos. Alright, Leonard Maltin, this has gone far enough! I ain't driving another mile until you tell me what this is all about!! Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but- (He gets a chill) Woo... Insurance salesman? Okay, you know what? Never mind. I don't need to know all this -- forget I asked. And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has? Mecha-Streisand? Oh man, I don't know what the hell that means, but it doesn't sound good! I don't know, man... Maybe Barbara Streisand doesn't have a place up here after all. There's a plan B? Why the hell have we been driving around all night and day for when there's a plan B?!?! Oh, come on. Don't tell me The Cure has something to do with this too! Woa, what's the matter, Leonard Maltin?! Where?! Oh, fudge!! CHILDREN!! (Struggling) I can't break these locks!! Uh, yes, is this Robert Smith of the Cure? This may sound kind of strange, but Leonard Maltin asked me to call you. Look out, children!! Sidney Poitier?!?! Damn man, it's nice to meet you! THE Sidney Poitier in MY home town!! Yup. She's made the diamond of Pantheos, alright. Is that really necessary? It's over... She's too strong for them children. We'll have to leave town. We have to say goodbye to South Park... Who are you? You can try Robert Smith, but that thing just beat the crap out of Leonard Maltin AND Sidney Poitier!! Hey, where is he going? Naw, I'm new in town. I'm gonna open up my own restaurant here! Damn, baby, you cut right to the chase, don't you. Hello? Boy, what the fudge are you doing?! Get in here! (Grabbing the afro) Take off that wig!! Now what's gotten into you? What? No... (Thinking to himself) Uh... Did I? Oh! Oh, that's different! Women don't get pregnant from tongue kissing, children! Of course not. Here, (Helping Cartman onto a stool) You children sit down and let me explain something to you about where babies come from. Then you'll see why I can't be your dad. (Singing) When a man loves a woman and a woman loves a man (Actually, sometimes the man doesn't love the woman, but he acts like he does in order to get some action.) The magic starts to happen and the two take off their clothes -- that's right. They caress and touch each other until a part of the man grows. Oooh, they roll around and now things are really starting to get hot. And the man say, ""I love you"" and the woman says, ""Hold on a second, I gotta go to the bathroom."" So you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait and... You wait and you wait and you wait. You wait and you're cooling down and she's still going to the bathroom. Finally she comes back and she says, ""Baby I'm getting hot."" And that's when you gotta jump her butt and pump her full of... Oh, children, that was a long time ago... But I'll tell you what I remember... Damn woman, what's gotten into to you? Garrison!! What the hell are you doing?! Ah, MAN!! I'm outta here! Yeah, when two women are involved! And THAT'S who she was with last... Mr. Garrison. Is everybody okay? That sounded like a gunshot! Is he dead?! Wait! He's still breathing! He's not dead! We have to get him to the hospital! Come on, children! Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter Birney memorial towel. I actually was with Meredith Baxter Birney in this very car, and afterwards, we used that towel to... Wait a minute, why am I telling you this? What? We have to get to the hospital! Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop Mephesto off, and then we can get out of there, alright? Come on children, we gotta find a doctor! Doctor! Doctor, we've got a shot cracker outside! WOA! Wait a second, they've closed the pass? What do you want me to do? I used to watch Quincy. So how do we get to it? The power!! You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now we don't know who tried to shoot you, but -- Oh. He went off looking for Mr. Kenny. What?! You mean that at the drunken barn dance... When we all got together with her she was a HE? Hello there, children! Bad. Children, I heard about what happened at school today. Now, none of you took that nasty marijuana, did you? Okay. Because I just want to tell you that DRUGS ARE BAD! Right. Bud do you know WHY they're bad? And do you have any idea what that means? Look, children. This is all I'm goin' to say about drugs- stay away from them. There's a time and place for everything, and it's called, 'College.' Do you understand? Okay. Oh, hell no! I can't bear to see that! Don't you boys know what a bris is? They're going to circumcise him. Oh boy. Here we go again.  Children. Uuuh. What's the one thing that's more sacred to a man than anything else in the world? Nono no, children, I'm talkin' about the most important part of a man's body. Tsk. That's right. A fireman? Goddammit, children! Why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you?  Ask your parents for once! So let's have half the children on this side  and half the children on that side Play ball! Aheeheh, you're out, Clyde! Heheheh. Concentrate on your ge-hame! Be the buhaw-hall! Great catch, Kyle! Now your team's on offense! Okay, that was pretty good, Pip. But you're supposed to hit the kids on the other team. That nose is bleeding pretty bad, Kyle. I think you might have to go to the nurse's office. Sorry, son. You'll have to let the nurse look at it. Come on Children! Great news! We've been asked to play in the State Finals for dodgeball! You-you don't understand, children. If we can win State, we can play in the Nationals in Washington, D.C.! That's right! Now, come on! We have a lot of practicing to do! Okay children.  Now, who's gonna win the State Finals? Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh! Unh! But it's quicker to get to the Denver school that way! How mant times do I have to explain this to you?! I'm not a student! You can't give me an office referral, and-! Yes, ma'am. I'm Chef, coach of the South Park Cows. Yeah. Dammit, Come on!  Somebody catch the ball! Great job, children! Just stay focused now Whoahohoho! Great shot, Pip! You got just one more, Pip. You get this kid, and we are State Champions. We did it, children, we did it! We're going to Washington, D.C.! Oh. Sorry about whuppin' your ass there, Coach. How much further is Washington, D.C.? I need to know how far it is, lady! Yeah, whatever, you old, dried-up, fat ho. Ah-I said, 'I've always wanted to visit Prague.' Damn, man. This is the big time, alright. You can eat after the game! You children win this one, and you're National Champions! Then you can go on and play the Chinese. What? Yeah. What? We did it! Children, we won! Okay, children. Back in the bus. Okay, children. Now, we're almost to China! I want you all to try and focus on your game. Nonsense! If we win this one, we're world champions! And just what price would you pay for eternal glory?  Just imagine: a big yellow Dodgeball Champions banner hanging in the cafeteria! Imagine it! You'll be in the news all over the world. South Park will finally have a sport that it's good at. Oooh, children. It'll be glorious. Hey, hey hey!  Children, that's not cool! You don't make fun of somebody because of their ethnicity! Nonononono. That's different. I made fun of them because they are from China. You see, it's not okay to make fun of an American because they're black, brown, or whatever, but it is okay to make fun of foreigners because they are from another country. All right. Let's go, Cows! Let's show 'em what we've got. Holy crap.  God-dahamn! Oh! What have I done?  You know, Eric? I just realized something. I have been obsessed, and obsession isn't good. If we had won the world championship, what then?  It would only be a bigger letdown the nest year if we didn't win! Our lives would have to revolve around dodgeball. Our lives were fine before! Oh, I'm sorry, children. I let it all go to my head. Can you ever forgive me?  Come on, forget this stupid game! Let's go home. Shut up, Pip!  CHEF Hey, children, everybody! I'm back! I'm back from Aruba! What the-? Hello there, children! Children, this whoole film festival thing has quite lucrative monetary possibilities. Now I'm gonna sell some of my famous cookies, to these Hollywood types, and make a mint! They're little cookies, with fudge in the middle. And I call them, ""Fudge 'Ems"" I can just see the commercial now. ""Wife got you down? Boss makin' you angry? Kids yellin' atcha? Well, Fudge 'Ems."" And I've also got my double chocolate cookies, ""Fudge This."" Well, perhaps you'd like to try my low-calorie cookies, ""Go Fudge Yourself,"" or my all-natural, ""I Don't Really Give A Flying Fudge."" Huh? Whose goose? Get 'em while they're hot! My all new cookies! ""I Just Went And Fudged Your Momma!"" Children! I'm glad you're here! I want you to check out my new confectionaries. I think they're going to sell right through the roof! I call them, ""Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls."" Try 'em.  CHEF It's all gone to hell, children. And we're all to blame. Even me!  I was sellin' out my town, too! And now look at it. There's nothin' we can do. Just sit here and suck on my balls. Come on, Kyle. It's time to go. Well, uh-I kinda hope not.  I mean, sure it does.  Here. I'll give him one of my Salty Balls to take with him to poo heaven.  Come on, let's go. My Salty Chocolate Balls must have re-juvenated him! You're daaamn right. Well, it worked once before. Oh, damn it. Not now!  Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery! What makes you think I would know anything about that? Well you get it by sharin' relations with somebody who already has it. You have to be veerryy careful arond someone who has herpes. Well, there's old Frida down on Main Street. She has a mouthful of herpes. You need to stay away from her. Oh, then, Frida's the right person to go to. O-kay!  Wait a minute. What the hell did I just do? Hello, children. Welcome to the planetarium. I love my work. And then, they'll ask, ""Truth or Dare?' No no! You say, ""Truth."" You have to say ""Truth"" the first few times. Or else, you seem too eager. You can't seem too eager. You've got to play it cool, like you don't even care what happens. Then, after a few ""Truth""s, you finally answer, ""Dare."" But not like that, son. Like this: ""Daaare"" And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy. Of course she will. They're women. They've had this whole thing planned out months ahead of time. Hello there, children. What did you say?? Eric? Wwhere did you hear that song? Well, I'll be sodomized on Christmas. Children, I wrote that song twenty years ago! Yeah! Back when I used to be in the rock business. And now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs. Aw, I don't want any money. I'd just like to see my name on the credits, that's all. ü¾ ¼Well aalll right. Maybe I will go. I'll play them my version of the song. Well, you see, Mr. Big Record Producer, ""Stinky Britches"" was something I wrote several years ago. Huh?? Now, look. I'm tryin' to be cool about this! But you just can't rip people's music off! It's against the law! Sue me?! You stole one of my songs, and you are going to sue me?! Right. Why 'Oh oh'? Oh oh. What? Woops?! Do I look like I have $2 million? This can't be happening! Ey, that's my favorite chair! Hey, children. Children, that record company guy is takin' all my belongings. And if I don't come up with $2 million, I'm goin' to jail. Okay okay, childrem, thank you very much. I feel much better. Sure, sure. Just please, stop. This? This is my photo album of all my times in the rock business. Did I?  Janis Joplin, the Beatles, Elton John. I got to travel all around the world, hangin' out with bands, goin' to lavish parties , lovin' many, many women . Nothin' . Anyway- Heeyy! That has no monetary value! What the hell are you takin' that for? Well, I have twenty-four hours to come up with your money! That's the law! That does it! You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna raise that $2 million, but I'm NOT gonna use it to pay you back! I'm goin' to use it to hire Johnny Cochran myself, and sue you! Watch me! Now, GET THE FUDGE OUT OF MY HOUSE! Okay. Thank you, Mr. Cochran.  Well, Johnny Cochran will take my case if I can pay his legal fee: $2 million. Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I did was cook for them. Uh I appreciate that, children, but raisin' $2 million is not an easy thng to do.  My only hope is to whore myself to every woman in town.  Wish me luck, children. Hey, Elton. Don't feel so down, baby. Have some of my Scottish haggis. It'll cheer you up. Look, Elton. You are a great singer, but a retarded monkey could write better lyrics. What you need is a guy to write realy good lyrics for you. I know a guy named Bernie Taupin who's workin' at Moth Burger right now. I'll give him a call. And Elton. Why don't you get yourself some new threads? You know. Some slick trousers and shit. No problem, Mrs. Broflovski. Uuh, now, about that hundred bucks? I've got a loohohohohohohohohong way to go to raise the kind of money I need. There, there, Cous-Cous. It'll be all right. Maybe you just need to change your image. Nobody wants to see a guy called Cous-Cous. You need a big, strong, beefy name. Aw, that's not bad. Here, have some meatloaf. Uh, uh, hold on a second, Ms. Crabtree. How would you like to use someü¾ ¼ sex toys? Like this very special device.  I call it ""Chef's Pleasure Bag."" Now, all you do is put this paper bag over your head, and it increases your sexual pleasure. Aaah, yeah. That's much better. I can't keep doin' this. It's killin' me! I'm serious! I'm not gonna make it. It's over, children. I couldn't raise the $2 million to hire Johnny Cochran, and now I have to go to jail. Huh? Did what?! Wow! How much did you make? Ooh. I made about $410,300, but- Good-bye, children. Thanks for all your help. Ow! What the hell did you do that for?! Ow!  Ow! You've finally snapped, huh, Garrison? Don't you get it, Garrison? It's all you! You're Mr. Hat and Mr. Twig! You've got split personalities schizophrenic jeebies. What?? No, Garrison! Shut the hell up! What the?! How the hell did he reach the gas pedal? What the hell is this? Mr. Hat busted me out. Children, did you do this? I don't believe it! You will? It feels greaheet! I just can't fuhind the words to thank all the artists who put on Chef Aid. And most of all, I want to thank the children. Hello there, children! All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries. Or haaauuunted hash browns. And a creeeeeepy cookie, and moooooonstrous milk! And a teeeeerrifying napkin! What?! Well, what's the first problem? Oh. Well, uh, don't worry, Stan. I'm sure it'll work out. Now, what's the other problem?  Oh, nohoho.  Oh, DEAR GOD, NO! Exactly what do you remember? Of course! That's it! Don't you see, children? This Cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite! Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe! How do you mean? What the-?  Oh, what now?! Children, what the hell are you doin'? You children shouldn't be crucifying yourselves in this heat. Eric, I have to tell you something, and it's really gonna bum you out. It's really gonna piss you off. This is just a dream. You're still up on that cross. Oh! Hello there, children! Oh! Didn't they tell you? I quit. Well, it's true. Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on kama sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and really hit it off. No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself. Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica. Children, Veronica is moving in with me. I'm in love. Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me. Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too. We have a chance to find the sunshine. Hello there, children. Eric, you got glasses! Huh? You bet! Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old. Why not?? Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even you will have to face with each other some day. That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did. You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball? Oh! Uh, hello there, children. Oh, children, I'm sorry. I forgot. Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner.  She's so amazing. Children, I've got some great news for you. Veronica and I are getting married. My whole family's coming here for the wedding, and I want you boys to come, too. If we can hold on through the night. Who? Not now, children! I gotta get fitted for my britches! Be right back. It's okay, pop. What?! All right guys! That's enough! I have had it with you! This is the happiest time of my life, and you can't be happy for me! No buts, Stan!  I love this woman, and I am marrying her! Now you can either accept that, or get out of my life! Now if you'll excuse us, we're having a party. Iii do! Children! You are screwing up my wedding! What the-?! What the-?! No I'm, I'm glad you did, children. Now that she's gone, I can't really figure out what I ever saw in her. Come on, children. Let's go get some ice cream. Hello there, children! How would you like some fish sticks and tater tots? Yeah, well, I learned a very important lesson this week: Daaamn right, Garrison! And those jakovasaur eat three times as much as normal children! I can't keep up! Hello there, children! How's it going? Well, they're about to get worse. All I can serve you for lunch is lumpy potatoes. Sorry, children. All my funding's been cut. I don't know, children.  Why don't you ask your dad? He's a lawyer, ain't he? Well, somebody else has got to know all about this sexual harassment whosafudge. Well, I hope you do. Otherwise, it's lumpy potatoes from here on out. Is everybody okay? What the...? Well, I must say I still don't get this at all. Father, why did you go to all this trouble? Including killing people and wreaking havoc all over South Park? Well thanks a lot, KoRn! You KoRn powers really came through for us! Oh, hello Stan. How's it going? Why bad? Well, sure.  Now, what's the matter, little cracker? OOH, you're talkin' about your older sister, Shelley. Your little girlfriend, Wendy. Look, Stan. Do you really know what a period is? Stan, let me sing you a little song about the menstrual cycle. I think it might clear things up for you. Ooo baby, yeah baby, ooo baby. ...Is that what I said? Whoa! I musta missed a WHOLE middle part there. We have to think carefully. We can ask him anything we want, like, ""What's the meaning of life?"" or ""Why are we here?"". Hello there, children. Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school charges extra for that. Oh my God! There has got to be at least fifteen dollars here! Well! Look at you cute little crackers! With your money and your fancy clothes and your cell phones, it's almost like you were-  Oh my God, children! What have I told you about drugs?! That's right. And the only thing worse than doin' drugs is dealin' drugs! I'm gonna tell you about when I was your age and got offered drugs. Uh? You're not? Oh, uh weh-ell, children, whatever you're doin', just remember this: havin' money may seem fun, but...  Ooh, uh-oh, never mind. Damn, that little Amanda was fine! I'm gonna look her up. Hello there, children. How's it goin'? Everything's fine?? Why?? What?? So that's why all you children are acting so damned boring! Damnit, children, you don't need drugs to make you pay attention in school! In my day, if we didn't pay attention we got a belt to the bottom! Now they're tryin' to cure everything with drugs! Oh, it makes me sick! Those damned psychologists prescribe all kinds of medicines to you children without even carin' about the side effects. Parents, I called you all together because I think you might be making a mistake puttin' your children on Ritalin. I know you wanna help your kids, but I brought over a videotape to show you that there are alternatives to Ritalin. There's this doctor in Northern California who is doing really amazing kids with children who have ADD. I want you to watch this tape. Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee. What the? Damnit, have you all been taking your children's Ritalin too?! Awww, fudge it! The what?? Hold on a second: you children want to go see Phil Collins? Oh my God!! That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I'm going to go see that damn phramacist! Hey, open this damn door. Yes you can! What the hell are you two doin' prescribing all the children Ritalin?! I know what it is! But now you've got a town full of zombie children from the planet Zandor. All around the country, you bastard doctors are giving children Ritalin! And for every one child that actually needs it, you give it to 50,000 that don't! You're damn right I'll tell you yo' business, because you two have got your heads up your asses! Thanks to you, we have children in our town that like Phil Collins! That's right! You've made them so dull and boring that they'er actually going to go to a Phil Collins concert! Well, how do we reverse the Ritalin?! Then we need an antidote! Alright. Come on, we've got to get the antidote to all the children. Quick! Here. We can put the Ritalin antidote in these drinks and hand them out to the children. Here you go, Stan and Kyle. Free drinks on me. Come on, drink it down. It's free. Drink this, Eric.  God help me! Heh, get it...  She's gone! Thank God! I think it's working. Mayor, as I've said before, I find that flag to be racist and insensitive! That flag represents a time when blacks were persecuted by whites! How can a black man not be bothered by it?! You don't see anything wrong with that flag?! Yeah! Look, I have gone to every quiet protest I could! I have written everyone; I've put up signs! But now I'm telling you , THIS FLAG WILL BE CHANGED! Sign up to join me, and come marchng to the Mayor's office in protest of the South Park flag!  You see that, children?! Nobody wants to get involved! Randy! Sign up to march with me against the South Park flag on Wednesday? Well, alright, Marsh, you're entitled to your own opinion.  That's how it is in this town. I haven't gotten one signature on this damn sheet, and I've been here all day! That's nice, but I need the support of some registered voters.  Ey, Mackey! Sign up to march on Wednesday? Alright, fudge it, Thursday. Anyone else wanna go Thursday? Fine! Next Sunday! Monday?? Okay! On Saturday, we march! To bring down the South Park Flag! My name isn't Chef anymore, children. I've converted to Islam. From now on, my name is  Abdul Mohammed Jabar  Rauf Kareem Ali.  With everyone in town so insensitive about the flag, I find it no longer fitting to use my slave name! You WHAT?!  You don't think they should change the flag?! Well, that figures you don't! Because your cracker-ass parents turned you into little cracker-ass cracker-racists! I never thought I'd live to see this many of the people I considered friends turn against me! But nothin'!  ""But"" my ass! Fix your own damn food! Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag!... ...Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag!  In the 1960's there was a monk  who set himself on fire to protest! You have left me no choice!  To protest your lack of humanity, I will now do the same thing! Change the flag! No, damnit! How can you all just stand by and let these racists do this?! Aw, the hell with all of you indecisive bastards! I ain't gonna listen to nothin'! This whole cracker-ass town can kiss my ass! Whoa whoa whooaa! You just missed the point entirely! I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist! Children, don't you even know what this argument is about?! That flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people. Ooooooohhh?! But that's a black man up there! Well of course it matters when-  ...Oh my God. Wait a minute. You children didn't even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people, did you? Why, that is- that is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard. Don't you see? All this time I thought these little crackers had turned racist, when actuallih they were so not racist that they didn't even make a separation of black and white to begin with. All they saw when they looked at that flag was five people. I'm sorry, children. I was wrong about you. But I still the flag needs to be changed. But now I realize that I almost let racism turn me into a racist. Oh, I know you don't, Jimbo. I've known you for almost ten years. You're a good man. I think that's a much better start than me tryin' to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers. Hooray! Oh! Oh-ah, hello Eric. Wellll, if you uuhh, come back in just a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can help you out. Alright, Eric, what's the matter? Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, Boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect. The law of physics that states, ""If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming."" All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazih! Uh-uh, except for Lilian, of course. You're welcome. Now, go away!  A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either! What's the problem? You call that a problem? That sounds like heaven to me. Oooo! Call the doctor! Uuuh, Ms. Choksondik, Mr. Garrison had several uuh, eee-motional issues. He was a closet homosexual who hated gay people. Whenever someone asked him if he was gay, he'd go nuts. Some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin', ""I'm not gaaay! I'm not gaaay!"" You know I'm always here to help, Principal Victoria. Hello there, children! Dag-nabbit children! How come every time you come in here you gotta be askin' me questons that I shouldn't be answering?! ""Chef, what's the clitoris?"" ""What's a lesbian, Chef?"" ""How come they call it a rim jub, Chef?""  For once, can't just come in here and say, ""Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?""! It sure is! Thank you. Uh uh! You children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again. Oh my God. Eric? Why do you need to know what a prostitue is anyway?! Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute. Well, because, children, a prostitute is someone who... you could pay for certain services. Like keeping you company. Understand? You see, chidren, sometimes a man needs to be with a woman. But sometimes, when the lovin' is over, the woman just wants to talk and talk and talk and talk. And that's why I say- Oohhhh  ...James Taylor, what the hell are you doin' in here?! Singing' about prostitutes to the children! Get out of here!  ...These children tricked me! Oh!! Baby you are so fine, and shit! Uh, from your ass, children. Oooh. The Black Death? Are you sure? LaToya Jackson, children. But I think back in those days it meant something else: the plague! It says here the word, ""shit"" has been around for over 600 years. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word, ""skite."" The Black Plague. Over half of Europe was killed by it. Look at this, children.  It says that the people in England believed that the plague was a curse, a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a word of curse. Of course! I've never even thought about why we use the term ""curse word"" before. Children, we've got to warn those producers in Hollywood that the plague, and ""shit,"" could be linked! Hold on a minute, Mr. Producer! My name is Chef, and these are the children! We've come to warn you about ""shit."" Hey! Hold on a minute! Haven't you people noticed all the strange things going on? Damn cracker-ass producers! I don't know, children. I guess we've got to get the word out to people some other way. Who are you? We've got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about. Children, we're goin'ta have to go to the land of castles, knights, and kings! 'Scuse me. Do you work here? We just need help identifying this. Aah, yeah. We didn't mean to. But I don't get it. People use curse words all the time. Knights of Standards and Practices? Oh no! Tonight is the ""Night of a Million Shits"" on HBC! It's gonna be said over and over! Hello, Eric! I made some chili to enter into the contest. This is a chili cook-off, ain't it? It's my special recipe. Look, parents. Do you really want your children learning about sex? Part of the fun of being a kid is being naive! Let them be kids for a while. The first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic about STDs. Hello there, children. How is sexual education class going? Yeah, I don't think Ol' Mackey knows a hymen from a hysterectomy. And Choksondik? I'd be surprised if she's ever gotten laid in her life. ...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children, you're holdin' up the line. Kindergarten?! Aw, now this is getting ridiculous! Oh, no! Well, I hate to say it, but you all got what you deserved. Look: Schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each say! But sex isn't something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams. Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs to be taught by family. I know it can be hard, parents, but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids, you don't know who they're learning it from. It could be from someone who doesn't know,  someone who has a bad opinion of it,  or even a complete pervert. It's very simple, children. The right time to start having sex is...  17. Seventeen. Nope, just 17. Seventeen! You're ready. Shovel that snow, babih, it's all nice, heavy and wet. Just- For what? But... I'm not rich. I'm just a school cafeteria chef. Ahah I don't make much money. Woo, fudge the snow now. I shall perservere. We shall perservere. Children, Kenny has been diagnosed with a... terminal disease. Oh, isn't that nice? You've got lots of friends, don't you Kenny? Hello there, children. How's it goin'? Yeah. Things have been better. Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes.Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand. Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop. Then you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then it would have nothin' to cry about. That's like God, who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears. You see, it's our tears, Stan, that give God his great power. Hello there, children. Fifty pounds? Why? Well, if you want him to get really fat as fast as possible, one of you will have to marry him. It definitely worked for every woman I ever met. Well, I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way. Come on back, children. I'm runnin' out, children. You're gonna give children AIDS?! Stand back, children! Jared wants to give you AIDS! Eh so he was saying, children should have help like he had! Oh. Hello there, children. Uh, how's it goin'? Oh, you wanted to see the new TV, huh? Pretty cool, ain't it? Uh, I don't know. This TV has more features than the space shuttle.  I can't figure it out at all. Russell Crowe?? Children, you shouldn't be this show about a man who beats people up because he's insecure. Why can't this guy control his temper? Yeah, and it's got all kinds of cool feature, too. Check this out. You can watch three channels all at once. I think if you hit this button here- No, no wait. You hit this button here No, that's not it. Let's see.  Menu Function Let's see.  Aw, damnit! I'm tryin', children! Menu, back, function- Enter? No, no. Back. H.E.M. Yes, is this customer service? I'm havin' problems with my new television. It sprouted legs and guns 'n started walkin' around shootin' people. Uh huh. Okay. Oh, so I press ""menu,"" then ""function."" No, that didn't work. Did I set it at ten o'clock? Uh, no.  Oh, really? Well, how do I do that? ...Yes, I pressed ""menu"" three thimes! No! It's givin' me the same error message! Yes I read the instruction maual! Oh, welll, hello there, children. Ohh, I'm sure your little cracker problems ain't all that bad. Come on in.  Now, just sit down and take a deep breath and tell ol' Chef what's goin' on. Nowww, children, every problem can be worked out. What was it? ...Oh, children, that's a problem we all have to face at one time or another. Here: let me sing you a little song that might cheer you up. Sometimes you kill your teacher and they find your semen in her stomach, and uh Wait! What the what?! Alright, children, I got you four tickets to Thailand  and three hundred dollars cash . It's gonna be tough living for a while. You might have to do things for money you never thought of doin' before. ...Wait, what? Sea people? Uhh, maybe you'd better start from the beginning. Oohhh, children, you misunderstood. Sea people is different from se-men. Yes! That stuff that was in that vial didn't come from you, it came from someone else.  I thought you children took turns rapin' and then murdered the teacher. Relax, children, junk that's in brine can't kill you. Your teacher must have died from something else. Alright. You children have had a long night. Why don't we all get some rest and on Monday, I'll sing you a song explainin' the difference between semen and sea people.  Come on, children. I'll walk you all home. Hello there, children! Yeah. In fact, that episode was a rip-off of a Twilight Zone episode. Good for you! Hello there, children! Good-bah! Hello there, children! How's it goin'? Why bad? ...Intolerant of who? Now why do you wanna go be intolerant of gay people, children?  I thought you knew better. Children, a lot of times the reason get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves. You have to ask yourself, ""What is it about their behavior that, for some reason, makes me unconfortable?"" Right. And you see, children, that's why you need to- Whoa! What?! Children, there's a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you understand that?? You children just take your lunches. I'm gonna have a talk with the principal. You don't need three lunches, Eric! You're fat enough as it is! Sending Chef to a tolerance seminar?! You've got to be fuckin' crazy!! He IS a sick queer!! Kiss my black ass!! Hello there, children. Well what's wrong with him? Children, why didn't you tell me about this sooner? Well you should. Cartman is your friend whether you like him or not! Now, come on! We've gotta get to that hospital! Cartman? Oh my God! Eric, how long have you been channelin' Kenny? Kenny? Kenny, do you know what you need to get free? Ms. Cartman, we need to get Cartman to a meeting room to speak with people who have crossed over. This hospital isn't gonna do any good. We need to take him to see John Edward. That's right. We have to go see him in New York. Good. You children need to come too. Eric needs all the support he can get right now. This must be the place. Don't worry, Eric. I'm sure he will be able to help you. Look uh, Mr. Edward, can you just ask Kenny how we can get him out, please? Aw man, I can't believe I got fooled by that asshole! Yeah. They must edit his shows down on television to only show him getting mostly right answers. We've got no choice. The only people I know now who might be able to help Eric are my parents. We'll have to take the next flight to Scotland. Okay children, this is your flight back to Colorado. Your parents are meeting you at the airport in Denver. Come on, we gotta catch our plane. You children get right on that plane now. Hi Pop. These are my friends, the Cartmans. Hi, Momma! Mom, this is my friend, Ms. Cartman. Yeah, Pop. This is Eric. The victim child? Where were we gonna find a child to secrifice? What do we do with it now? Eric, you're okay! Well, come on. We'd better get Kenny back to his parents. Wait a minute. Who's got the pot roast? Aw, damnit! Come on!  We've gotta find him! Kenny! Hello there, children! Well, today it's Salisbury steak with hot buttered noodles Say, did any of you children What the? A repeat?? I've been feelin' dü¾¼jü¾¼ vu all mornin', children. I knew somethin' strange was goin' on! We have to get Eric to a proctologist right away. He's a doctor that specializes in your asshole, children. That's right. Hello Doctor. Thanks for seein' Eric on such short notice. We just want you to take a look and tell us if you see anything abnormal. Eric, the doctor has to feel inside your rectum. Well, doctor? That wasn't no hemorrhoid, it was an alien hoobajoob! Come on, children! We've got to get Eric to some real help! That thing inside Eric's asshole looked like some kinda alien satellite dish. We need to see my friend down at the Space Center now! And you're the only person I could think of who might be able to help us, Jeff. Someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did. Kyle, the fate of the world may be at stake. Eric, that's enough! It stopped being funny forty seconds ago, boy! Let's just get this over with! Okay. Now it's funny again. What's it doing? Where is the signal being sent to? Help! Get in the car, children! Get in the car! Can you see anything, children? God damned aliens! Hold on, children!  We have to ditch them! I don't think we're outta the woods yet. That ain't no police! HA! God-damned aliens! I beat you! Where'd you learn to drive, aliens?! Chinese auto school?! You're lucky I didn't just turn around and beat your white skinny alien asses anyway! Maybe next time you'll remember to...  Huh?  Aw crap! Children! Jeff!! The aliens took the children up on their ship. Did you find out what the aliens were up to? They took the children, Jeff! I have to know what those aliens are up to! Butt sex? Who's havin' butt sex? What the hell is that?! Chaos theory?? Huh? Oh my God! We have to stop them! We have to find a way to stop those aliens! Oh no. That doesn't make any God-damned sense! Hello there, children! Yeah! Let the South Park people own South Park! What do you guys think? I'm sorry, boys. You just don't understand economics. What's all this fightin' about, children?! Aw nah. Don't tell me you children have taken up this whole metrosexual fad, too! No it isn't. Last year you children were all trying to be black, and now you're trying to be gay! Well, then, don't buy into this fad, Kyle. Be who you are, not what's cool. Oh, hello, Mr. Garrison. Sure. Come on in. Well, what do you want me to do about it? Oh. Well, we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them. Well, like with our slang. Black people always used to say, ""I'm in the house"" instead of ""I'm here."" But then white people all started to say ""in the house"" so we switched it to ""in the hizzouse."" Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying that, and we had to change it to hizzie, then ""in the hizzle"" which we had to change to ""hizzle fo shizzle,"" and now, because white people say ""hizzle fo shizzle,"" we have to say ""flippity floppity floop."" Oh no! Damnit! Don't call it that! The Broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new Canadian Prime Minister. What if this Christmas, instead of buyin' presents, we all use that money to give to the Broflovskis? Hello there, children! How's it goin'? Why bad? No, can't say that I have. Hey, what are you children doin' with those weapons? Well, you children should be careful with those. You could put somebody's eye out. Well, I've gotta get to the fairgrounds. They're about to start the big auction. So long, children! Oh. Hello there, children! Oh boy... Well come on inside, children. I'll make you some cocoa. Have a seat, children. Just try to relax and breathe.  Are you all okay? All right. Now, where did you get served? Okay okay, relax children. Relax. It's all over now. Just try to calm down and sit tight.  I'm gonna call your parents and let them know you're okay. Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it. Oh no!  No, stop Stan! You don't know what you're doin'! No no no! Oh damnit! I knew that was gonna happen. Stan, what the hell did you dance back for?? Now you've gotta compete against them in the dance competition on Saturday! Because if you get served and served them back, then it's on! Don't you know anything?? Oh Lord... All right, children, let's get to rehearsin'! We don't have much time, and you've got to become the dance group you can be.  I think we should-  Whoa.  This... is the dance troupe? Oh boy.  All right, well, why don't you show me what you got? I wanna see what you kids can do! Oh Lord have mercy.  Children, children! No no, you've got it all wrong. Don't you see, children? You have the heart, but you don't have the soul. Nono, wait. You have the soul, but you don't have the heart.  Nono, scratch that. You have the heart and the soul, but you don't have the talent. All right all right, quiet, children! Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it. We just gotta buckle down, dig deep, and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer. Rules are you have to have five dancers. We have no choice, children. We have to forfeit. All right! My God. Look at all these incedible bargains. Sir, we just had a big town meeting, and decided we don't want your Wall*Mart here anymore. They why don't you just quit?! No no no! Let's freeze it! Get out! It's gonna blow! We know how to destroy it now. Spread the word to all the towns! Mayor, we have got to do somethin' about all these potholes on our roads! We- Yeah. We apologise. Yeah, yeah! I get it! Fine! Now, now, don't cry, ladies. Everything's gonna be fine. ...I didn't volunteer! ...Aw damnit! I'm alive!"

"CATTLE RANCHER","That's the third cow this month, at this rate all my cattle are gonna die before the Winter's through. People been sayin' they've been seeing UFO's around. Yea, and black army CIA helicopters and trucks. What was that? What am I supposed to do Barbrady? Just stand here and watch my cattle get mutilated one by one? Hey, my cattle!! You see there is something funny going on."
"OFFICER BARBRADY","This is nothing out of the unusual. Cows turn themselves inside out all the time. UFO's?? Ha Ha. That is the silliest thing I've ever heard. That, that was a pigeon. There's nothing funny going on. I'll get those cows back. Hold it right there cows. Come back here! Ha ha cows, I got you cornered. Let's see you get away now! (Singing) I love to sing-a! About the moon-a and the Juna and the spring-a! I love to sing-a!  About a sky of blue or a tea for two. Nice gun. Hmm... You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet. No problem. Ha! Caught you red handed! NO PICTURES OF Kathie LEE!! What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute... Hmm... You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet. I think the book depository would be a good bet. Book depository would be a good bet. Book depository good bet Book depository Damn! He could be anywhere! I'll send out an A.P.B.! Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat?! You're lucky you missed Kathie Lee Gifford and that nobody got hurt. Okay people, listen up! As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please. Okay, any questions? That's enough out of you! You boys have been watching the X files too much. There's no such thing as -- You're probably wondering why we're standing here with a pile of money and no pants on. Not a thingy dingy. Well, Evil Knieval, why don't you jump over them with your rocket cycle? Righteeo. What seems to be the problemo, here? Boys shouldn't you be in school? NO EXCUSES! MOVE ALONG YA LITTLE TROUBLE MAKERS!! Well what? Well, you ain't Fiona Apple. And if you ain't Fiona Apple I don't give a rat's ass. Hoo! What a bitch! I wouldn't mind gettin' a hold of YOUR cookies, Ms. Cartman! Mmm, that's a good cookie7! Huh, where? Oh my God! LOOK!! Woa, this is a good movie! Yeah, I'm gettin' hungry too. Whew! The short what? That's not how I played it. Yes. But at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost? What's that? I need to go poopies. Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it?! Uh... O... O... Did you kids actually learn how to read this way? I have just finished reading the heart warming novel 'Go Dog Go'. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche'. If I may read a passage: (Reading) Big dog..... Little dog..... A red dog..... On a..... Well, anyway, I don't want to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist turn that parallels my own life. Hooray!! Oh, pretty good... Who, Carla Weathers or the chicken? That's a pretty far-fetched story, boys. Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up? Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong. Oh, yeah. Let's go. Hello, Mr. Planetarium Operator. Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town. Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of. Okay, I'll be quick, then. Well, it's nice to see you finally got a real job, Chef. Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too. That would be super-duper! Oh, neato! Who? Pain. Ah-yeah, babe, yeah, babe Holdjit  If you wouldn't mind, uugh. Could you please follow me? Odle-oh who whoo? Not so fast there, tubby. Uh I'm just takin' care of business. Oh, thank you from a fate worse than death, counselor. What's all the hoo-ha? Why? If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just.  What do you have to say, carnival operator? Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started! Barbrady! You said Buttbaby. Oh, I think maybe you'll answer that downtown, tourists. What's all this? Ho-kay okay, let's calm down. People of South Park, do you declare Shenanigans on the carnival people? Okay, carnival people, do you accept this decree of Shenanigans? Well, that settles it! Everybody grab a broom, it's Shenanigans! All right, you dammned carnival people. Into jail with-  Oooooh? Yeah. Uh me, too. I didn't? Ooh, phew, I feel a lot better, then, although I could've swore that I had heard of them and they starved to death in my prison. What's this all about? Can I go now? Weirdo. I'm afraid it's the big house for you, fruitcake. Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you.  Okay, bye, then. Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur- T. T is for turtle.  Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur... Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants. Who are you? Political prisoners? No, these are child molesters. Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but these men aren't going anywhere until I hear from the FBI. Okay people , I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you! Wow, they've got activists for everything these days. Well, Chef, it's freedom of speech. We don't like it, but we can't arrest them for talking. Well okay. Next?  Next?  Let's see: Hotties, Juicy, Whoppers...  Okay, next? A-ha! What the hell are you doin' with this?! These are a weapon! I'll think of a way. Now move along! Alright, next!  Okay, clear. Uh what the hell was that? Hello, Mr. Marsh. Well, we've got a little problem. Gent here caught your boy and his friends trespassing on his ranch. They stole some of his property. Me?? How did I get into this mess? I am. But I don't want to be. Whoops, sorry I doubted your abilities, Mr. Negotiator. But isn't that dishonest? Here you go, Mr. Rancher. I got your cattle back for you What you do mean? Crime scene investigation!  There are several footprints in the snow. Perhaps more than one perpetrator? Is that the toilet paper there? I'll need to take those bags as evidence. You?! So where were you last night at around 9?! Aha!! Got you! Insurance? Now you listen to me! Whoever TP'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets. It's only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized! I have to stop that from happening. No I do not. I just need to talk to someonen who knows how toilet paperers think. Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady. I'm with the South Park police. I was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case? Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return? You... know I can't give you toilet paper, Josh. Well, that's kind of personal. Look kid, I have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Tell me what you know. So you think there was more than one. Why? Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles used to hit me with a belt! Yes, thanks for coming, Mr. Bell. A house was TP'ed in South Park and I need to see if you can identify the toilet paper I recovered from the scene. I'm... sorry I have to do this. Is this toilet paper from your store? Positive ID on the toilet paper. Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days? Well, like someone who was black or Mexican or Middle Eastern. Josh, I need your help. How do you mean? Yes. No, two-ply.  What? What does that tell you? To get revenge. What do you mean? I don't have time for this, kid. Alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles' laps! Oh. Of course! One of her students! Hello boys. How are you? It sure is! Right over here.  Yeah, we interrogated the suspect for over forty hours, and he finally cracked. His parents are on their way down now. Why do you say that? All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by. Huh?? Well, looks like I made a mistake. I... guess I'd better let you out now. Excuse me, everyone.  I have someone with me who can tell us all who toilet-papered the art teacher's house!  Josh insisted he be able to tell you the names of the toilet paperers in person. Uh, Policeman Brown, will you take Josh outside, please? Well, I guess my work here is done. After all this, I'm gonna need a long vacation. Okay, Josh, time to go back to the... Oh no! Couldn't you have gone after him? Police station. Josh? Josh, where are you?! Are you crazy? I just had my uniform pressed! There you are! Eric Cartman, you are under arrest. I was just over at your house and freed sixty-three people you had locked in your basement. Oh no, you're coming downtown! You can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement. I handled it, Mayor. Gee whiz. Yeah. Jimmy? Jimmy Valmer? Jimmy, what are you doing here? The talent show is inside. Not perform? But Jimmy, you love talent shows. Everyone in town knows that. Why? Well of course not, Jimmy. LIttle girls don't wanna have sex. Well, Jimmy, the girls here are young and pure. They're not like the ladies down at Colfax Point. Well yeah, those women will have sex with anybody. You're welcome, Jim.  Wait..."
"MR. GARRISON","And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us about Christopher Columbus. Is there a problem, boys? Oh really, Kyle? What is it this time?  Another prostate tumor? I don't know, Kyle. Did you ask Mr. Hat? Oh, I think you should ask Mr. Hat. Hmm, guess you'll have to take your seat, Kyle. Eric, do you need to sit in the corner until your flaming gas is under control? What the? I tell you, there is some crazy stuff going on in this town. Children! Children! remember the 'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay contest that you children worked so hard on last month? One of our VERY OWN South Park students has won the national prize!! That's right, Mr. Hat. The winner of the national 'Save Our Fragile Planet' contest is... ERIC CARTMAN!! Congratulations, Eric, on writing the award winning paper. Out of over a MILLION papers, Eric's was chosen as the grand prize winner! Wait, wait there's more! It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by... (Pause, gulp) Kathie LEE GIFFORD! And the presentation will be on national television! (Quietly, to himself) Kathie Lee Gifford... I don't believe it... Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement! Why are you looking at me like that, Mr. Hat? Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago, and I was only a child. It wasn't fair, she had choreography. How could we compete with that? How? No, Mr. Hat, I couldn't!! I couldn't... KILL Kathie Lee Gifford! That'll be wonderful! Won't it Mr. Hat? Mr. Hat!!!! Oh that's PERFECT! (To Mr. Hat) You see, Mr. Hat? We don't have to KILL her, we can just UPSTAGE her! NO, NO!!!! No, Mr. Hat! I won't do it! That does it. You're going in the dresser drawer Mr. Hat. Well, you can just stay in that drawer Negative Nancy. Huh? Oh... Fine, we were just about to run it from the top. Okay, All the little pioneers on this side of the stage. Good, and all the little Indians go to the center of the stage. Do you have a feather on your head? Then you're an Indian. Okay, BeBe this is your line. They did it a lot better this morning. They had more energy. Well, what do you want? This is how it happened in those days. TO HELL WITH Kathie LEE GIFFORD!!!!!!!! Oh my God... What have I said? I can't kill her, Mr. Hat! (Pause) You're going to have to do it! Yes... I need a gun. Other. (To the mirror) You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? (To the Gunsmith) I don't know... It's a little small. (To the mirror) You talkin' to me? (To the Gunsmith) Mmmm, no. I don't like this one either. You talkin' to me? I don't see anybody else around here. So you must be talkin' to me. I'll take it. Well Mr. Hat, I guess ol' Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow... She beat us in the talent show all those years ago... And I think we OWE her for that! BANG!!! Thank you. Thanks. Hello Officer Barbrady. Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot-a- view of Kathie Lee? Yes... Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you, Officer Barbrady. Damn! I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford. Come on, you little bitch... You've got to come out of your precious bubble sooner or later, Missy. Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot-a- view of Kathie Lee? You... Can't know... And then she finished it all by throwing her voice with TWO dummies at once. It is too late for me... Young Wendy. You're... You're right. Well children, I'd love to. But the doctors say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy... I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyone's chances for being on T.V. Really? On what? Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy for a leg and weaves baskets. South Park is saved! Thank you for that presentation, Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a D-. Who should we call on next, Mr. Hat? Oh, good idea. Okay, Stanly, you're next. Well, just make something up like Eric did. Excellent! A-. Eric, Stanly just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades, and we treat star athletes better, because they're better people. Of course Stanly, what is it? Oh... Well, Stanly, I guess you came to the right person... Sit down. (Soft and calm) Stanly... Gay people... Well, gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitus oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea sized brains which becomes the cause of their Nazi-esque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand? Good, I'm glad we could have this little talk, Stanly. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual. Oh, stop filling his head with that queer loving propaganda. What do you mean? WHAT?! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! I am not gay! I just act that way to get chicks, dumbass. Hey, hey, where's little Stanly? Richard Stamos can't sing a high F. He always screws it up like this. (heckling) It's obvious where all the talent in THAT family went! I thought you said beating the spread was a sure thing, Jimbo! What the hell is he talking about?! And now, children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about Genetic Engineering. Yes, Kyle. Well uh... Yes I suppose you could. Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie. Isn't this exciting, two A+ students in a cloning war! Uh, uh Stanley, Can I talk to you for a minute? I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have. Are there problems at home? Oh, dear... Here, Stanly, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it. Your sister? Oh, for Pete's sake, don't be such a little wuss! Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy little foo foo problems... and give me back my cocoa! Stan, are you wearing a different hat? HEY! I know a certain young man who is itching for detention! Stanly! What the hell has gotten into you? You have got severe lunchroom duty Mister! Yeah, you wait 'till your father hears about this. Everyone, let's give Casey and his weed a big hand. Okay, Kyle we're ready to see your science project. Oh well then I guess you get an F. Oh Mr. Hat isn't it beautiful. Children, children, a certain student's mother called me last night... She informed me that some of you might be watching a naughty show called 'Terrance and Phillip'. That's right, Mr. Hat, shows like Terrance and Phillip are what we call 'toilet humor'. They don't expand your minds. You see, children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash. Kenny, why are you late to class? Oh. Okay, Kenny. Be seated. Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because you -- yes Kenny, what is it? I thought you just came from the bathroom. Oh okay, okay, go ahead. As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There is much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad. Usually they get taken right off the air. You see you should be spending your time enlightening your mind with more intelligent entertainment. Pay attention, children! I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch Terrance and Phillip anymore, ever. That's right, children, are there any questions? (Pause) Yes, Stanly? What do you mean? Uh, Stan... I'm not touching that one with a twenty foot pole. Ooh, I think I've caught a touch of flu from little Kenny this morning. I've got the green apple splatters. No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me. Okay now, all you little Chewbaccas take your seats. Children, since today is Halloween, I thought we should learn something about the great horror writer Jackie Collins. You see, when Jackie Collins first wrote her novel.. Is there a problem Kenny? Let's try to keep our hands and arms to ourselves, okay? Okay children, let's get you lined up so the judge can get a good look at your stupid little costumes. Children, this year we have a celebrity judge. The star of 'Family Ties'... Miss Tina Yothers! Thank you, Miss Yothers. Okay, The Second Place award for best costume goes to... Kenny, for his Edward James Olmos costume! And the award for the Very Best Costume goes to.... WENDY! For her Chewbacca costume! And the award for the WORST costume this year goes to... STAN for his stupid little clown thing costume. Okay, children let's all gather around and bob for stupid apples now. You go first bebe... That's good, just use those mouth muscles like the girls in Beijing. Wait your turn, Clyde!! Children, children... Today is a very special day -- I'm not talking about your birthday, Eric. We have a new student joining our class today! Now, some of you know what it's like to be the new kid in town. So I want you all to take special care to make him feel welcome. I want you all to meet our new classmate... Uh... What's your name again? Say hi to Damien! And where are you from, Damien? Ooh, that's exciting. My mother was from Alabama. Your father? Wow, we have royalty in our class! Why don't you take your seat, Damien, we're going to finish our lesson on great singers of the Baroque Era. Now children, Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass... Damien, do you need to sit in time out for a few minutes? Holy poop on a stick! Yeah... I think I left your oven on, too... I was here first! Oh Yeah, me too! Hey! He isn't hurt! He took a dive! He threw the fight! Yeah, what a mean thing to do! Boy, did we get screwed. Children, children, to honor this special time of year, we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is? Yes, Eric? ...No, that's a Caesarian section, Eric... But that's okay. Remember there are no stupid questions, just stupid people. A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on Thanksgiving. Exactly. I don't know, Eric, they just do. Now children, I want each of you to bring in ONE CAN of food, and later the Mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people. Okay, kids, that's enough Dickens for one day. Let's get on with our lesson. Right Mr. Hat? What the hell is going on?! WAIT A MINUTE!!!! WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!! Kyle, what the hell was that? You need to hold the baby by the legs, not by the head... What kind of sick weirdo are you? And Wendy, I'm STILL not believing the labor pains. Well, I'm TRYING to direct the school Christmas play, but YOUR son was holding baby Jesus fetus by the head. So? Because it's Christmas. Oh, God, you're not gonna lay that Hanukkah crap on me are you? Oh, Okay! Kyle, is there anything you can do for the Christmas play that isn't related to Jesus? The Mr. Hankey song? How does that go? See, that's what you get when you raise your child to be a pagan. OH WAIT! WAIT! WAIT! I'm sorry. Was it the pagan remark?! You ARE the Jewish community! Could we get rid of all the Mexicans? Rats. Oh, do you have to take the Christmas tree too? Okay children, I'm really having a hard time with our Christmas play. So does anybody know any non-Santa or non-Jesus Christmas songs? Yes, Eric? What the... OH MY LORD!! KYLE, DID YOU JUST THROW DOO-DOO AT ERIC?!?! Okay, children, we've just received word from the Mayor that the Christmas play can't include any Christmas lights, since they offend people with epilepsy. So, Kenny, would you please go over and pull the light cords out of the wall? Careful now Kenny, those are very very dangerous. Okay, now let's practice our -- Okay, children, does everyone have their leotards on? Oh, brother... Kenny would you please climb that ladder and take down the star above the stage? And be careful not to fall in that little pool below you Kenny, the shark for the third act is in there. Okay kids, get ready to take your places. Hey! YOU'RE the ones who made it this way!! I have to admit I'm still embarrassed about getting a nose job, Tom. I didn't want people at school to know, so I told them I had herpes. Wow, isn't that amazing, Mr. Hat? Hmm... Oh, that's not bad... WOW!!! THAT'S IT!! THAT'S THE NOSE I WANT!! I can live with that. Oh, I feel... Weak... How do I look? I feel kind of nauseous... (He's gonna puke) wuhh... wughhhh... Oh, stop! That movie was terrible!! (Weakly) Waited through that entire movie to see the alien and it was her goddamn father... Well? Hi, Mrs. Kimble. Really? No, but thanks for asking. Wow, Mr. Hat... Having a nose job is even better than I thought! There's a whole WORLD of opportunity opening up in front of us! I'm a lady killer, Mr. Hat! A few HUNDRED? Oh, boy, I'm gonna need some more smack. Eric, keep quiet! I'm trying to sleep! We're doomed!! Goodbye, Mr. Hat! You're DRUNK, Mr. HAT!! Damn! Damn, Damn! Oh well, guess It'll just have to be you and me, Ms. Cartman. Well, I guess we should go, Mr. Hat... Mr. Hat you need to admit you have a drinking problem... Another Cosmo please! What the hell are you talking about, Eric? I am NOT GAY!! No! Okay, okay! I admit it!! I might have made love to your mother at the Drunken Barn Dance!! But Who here DIDN'T?!?! Now come on! Honestly, who has NEVER had sex with Mrs. Cartman? You don't count, halfie! You don't have any legs! So you see, Eric. Anyone here could be your father. I'm afraid you're never going to know... Yes! For God's sake get on with it!! You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!! (In darkness) Hey, what the hell's going on? Mephesto's been shot!! Then who was it?! Yeah, God only knows who they'll kill next? I sure hope that I am not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat. (As Mr. Hat) You can say that again Mr. Garrison. What? Like sailors on a submarine. Whew! Ugh... Could we hurry this up, my stomach's growling! C... Can't go on... S-So H-hungry... Eat Eric Roberts... This snow just isn't letting up. We're going to die here, I know it. Oh, I can't go on... Oh, it's over... We're free! Well, I'm bringing home some Eric Roberts in a doggie bag, does anybody else want some? No, that doesn't make sense. Meaning what? Now children, we have a new student joining us today. Please say hi to Officer Barbrady. Okay, now since our focus has been on reading, let's review some of the basics. Yes, what is it? Officer Barbrady, in school we go to the bathroom before and after class. Give it a shot, Officer Barbrady. BZZZT!!! WRONG!! Try again, dumbass!! Okay, okay, I'm sorry... I'm sorry..Let's try again... Now children, I hope you all had a good time reading your books, and are prepared for your book reports. Who should we have go first, Mr. Hat? Let's see... Eric, why don't you go first. What's the matter, Eric? Are you not prepared again? No, I can't say that I have. And I give you an F, Eric. Now sit down. Okay, Officer Barbrady, why don't you give us your book report? Thank you, Officer Barbrady, that was a very good book report, indeed. I'll give you an A. You couldn't screw anything, halfie! You don't have any legs!! Conjugate the verb... Conjugate the verb. Yeah, now we're gonna make sure you get the help you need. And so now, children, your school counselor is back, to tell you first-hand about his nasty experience with drugs and alcohol.  MR. GARRISON What's Vietnam? A question a child might ask, but not a childish question. Heheheheheheheheheh. Children, for the next few days, we'll be learning all about Vietnam. Chances are that somebody in your own lives was affected by this incredible war. No, I wasn't in Vietnam. But sometimes, I like to pretend I was. Anyway, children, I'm going to assign you all a paper. I want you all to find somebody in your own life who was in Vietnam, and interview them about it. Then you get an 'F', fail the third grade, and have to get a job cleaning septic tanks to support your drug habit. Yes, uh.  Where the fuck did you hear this ridiculous load of bullshit?! Well, boys, it's obvious to me that you didn't do your work, and that you stayed up all night thinking up some ridiculous lie! You all receive an F. Minus. Stanley, the Vietnam war was war! There weren't galloping steeds or singing birds or logrides! Well that's it! All of you have detention for the rest of the week! Come on you little bitch. Leave us. We must finish what we have begun. She's not really Kathie Lee Gifford. She's some kinda alien. See, I told ya. Oh, no, you don't! The school year is over, but summer vacation doesn't start for you little bastards, until Mr. Hat is back on my desk! Now, I'm goin' to turn around, and when I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat lying right here!  Okay. Now I'm gonna turn around now.  Shit! Hhello, children. Hhhow is your summer goinnngg? Oohh oh, that old thing?  Whah, I almost forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. Hat. Mr. Hat is just a puppet Mr. Hat isn't real. Hello: Is this some kind of joke?! You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! I'm gonna find out who you are! God-dammit! ü¾ ¼ and I can't sleep or think uh.  Where would he have gone? Why would he leave? How the fuck should I know?! If I knew that, I wouldn't be seein' a fuckin' psychiatrist, would I?! At first, I was sure 'at one of the children took it. But then I remembered that Mr. Hat and I actually had a fight that morning. What?! Are you propositioning me?! Well, I can tell you that I am 100% NOT GAY. Mr. Hat, on the other handü¾ ¼ Sometimes he fantasizes about same-sex relations. Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with Brett Favre, and a bottle of Thousand Island dressing. Well, I'm just sayinü¾ ¼ I think you're the looney one in this room. Serves you right, you gay-bashing homo! Wow, it's a black blizzard! Oh, I'm through with Mr. Hat. He's a two-timin' whore. From now on, children, you're all gonna be learning from Mr. Twig. Okay, children. I have some very exciting news for youü¾ ¼ Oo-why don't you tell them, Mr. Twig? Nono, Kyle. These are independent films. Eric, if you call Wendy a bitch one more time, I'm sending you to the principal's office! That's it Eric, you-! Anyway, children, I want you all to see at least one independent film at the festival and then write a paper about it.  The first film showing is called Witness To Denial, and it's a sexual exploration piece about two women in love. Oh uub- hello, children. Oh I- I was just-uh hangin' out. Children, do you know how to file a police report? Good. See you in school. And so, children, that's how you tell a prostitute from a policeman. Now, are there any questions?  Yes, Kyle. Uhthat's a good question, Kyle. Are there any other questions? Right, right. Uub. Well, class, I'm going to assign you all a paper. The theme of the paper will be, ""How I would make America better."" Uhdon't worry, Kyle. I'm sending homework to all the children who are out sick. They'll have to turn in a paper, too. Okay, children, what do you think Barnaby Jones meant when he said, ""This is not a victimless crime""? Anybody?  Children, were you paying attention?! Oh, well excuse me, Kyle! Why don't you just forget what Barnaby Jones has to say?! Why don't you not pay attention to Barnaby Jones and then let's see how far you get in society?! Okay, Stanley, why don't you tell us how Barnaby Jones knew the poison was in the milk? Oh, and what do you consider normal?! Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants, it just so happens we are going on a field trip tomorrow! To the planetarium. Oh now, what's wrong with the planetarium? Well, too bad! You're all going to the planetarium and you're all going to love it! In the meantime, we're going to watch episode #203, Barnaby Under Siege. Oh, sorry, I taped these at home, so there's more commercials. Okay, children, let's quiet down so the nice bus driver can concentrate on the road. Ow! Jesus, lady! Okay, children, now I'm going to remind you that this is a planetarium, not a Bangkok brothel. Let's behave ourselves. Come on, Eric. We're going to the planetarium. No, you have to go in this building and see a bunch of stupid stars! Now, come on! That's a pretty weird bone disease. Well, kids, how did you like the planetarium? Really? What did you like best about it? Wait a minute. Where is Eric? You snuck off and sang that stupid song?! Oh, great! Well I guess we have to go back! We've better get him to the nurse's office, stat! Okay, children, today we're going to learn all about Japanese poems called haiku. A haiku is just like a normal American poem, except that it doesn't rhyme, and it's totally stupid. For example- Uh, where is Eric Cartman? No, I'm asking why Eric Cartman isn't at school. Was he on the school bus this morning? Hoh, very good haiku, Kyle. Yes- haikus have five syllables, then seven, then five. Kenny, can you give us another example? But you were just there! Why do you wanna go again so soon? Well, I guess we could go again, since it's just down the street. Eric, where have you been? Very good, Kyle. They just begged to come back; I couldn't get them to shut up about it. I'm just gonna step outside and go weewee. What the hell are you boys doing? You're supposed to be in there. Oh, for Pete's sake, Clyde. You just went! Well, I guess I could give them extra credit for it. And so, children, today we're gonna focus on American history, right Mr. Twig? What did you say?! I told you to never mention that name in my classroom again! Mr. Hat is a two-timin' whore! And now we all learn from Mr. Twig! That is enough! Mr. Hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and I don't wanna hear it! Anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104ü¾ ¼ Stan? Are you paying attention? Well, then, Stanley. What did I just say? ü¾ ¼Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention.  Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn't work. Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weighü¾ ¼ Stanley, are you passing notes to Kyle?! Don't lie, Stan. Lying makes you sterile. Stanley, if you think it's so important to keep interrupting my class, then why don't you come up to the front and read your note to Kyle for everyone to hear! Stanley Marsh, you come up here right now and read your note! You know, uh, excuse me, but I agree. These rides are really stupid! Chamber of Farts isn't scary at all! Hello children. Ready for lunch? Eric, is there a problem? ""Stinky Britches,"" by Alanis Morissette? Children, did you say 'hi' to Mr. Twig? I told you never to say his name in my presence! It just so happens that Mr. Twig is far more stable than Mr. Hat could ever be! So he's the better puppet! How DARE you?! Come on, Mr. Twig! Mr. Twig, is that you?  Mi, Mr. Twig? AAAAA! Mr. Twig! No!  Who did this to you, Mr. Twig?! Who?! I need some help over here! Please help! I think he's got third-degree burns! Is he goin' to be all right, doctor?! Is he goin' to live?! Damn it! Don't give me that medical ü¾ ¼jargon, just tell me straight! Is he goin' to be okay?! Hoh, I brought you some more juice, Mr. Twig. Are you feeling any better? Huh-I don't know who would want to hurt you like this, but I promise nobody will ever hurt you again, ever.  Mr.- Mr. Twig? Are you okay? Mr.- Mr. Twig? AAAAA! MR. TWIG IS BROKEN IN HALF!! WHO DID THIS?! YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS, YOU BASTARDS!! Thanks for coming, Officer Barbrady! These pictures just arrived. I set up a camera, and caught Mr. Twig's assailant red-handed! Now, go arrest 'im!  What?? Yes. Yes, uh-I'm sorry. It can't be. These can't be right. Mr. Hat!! Did you think I would just take you back? Like you can just, walk out and then, come back like nothing happened? Oh, don't look at me like that, Mr. Hat. Remember, you're the one that left! And I'm NOT goin' to take you back! You can just go to hell!  You go to hell and you die!  You are a lying ball of turd, Mr. Hat!!  I hope you starve, you lousy son of a bitch!!  What are you all looking at? This is just between me and Mr. Hat. Wuwhat do you mean? What?! Jail?? ü¾ ¼And Mr. Twig is at home; he has no idea Mr. Hat is even back. I mean, I care a lot about Mr. Twig, but Mr. Hat and I have so much history. What? ü¾ ¼I warn you, Chef! Don't even think of taking advantage of me in this prison cell! You still aren't entertaining any ideas of raping me here in this prison cell, are you, Chef? Well that's good. Oh boy, we're free!  Wow, what a daring rescue!  Mr. Hat!  Mr. Hat saved us, Chef!  Come on, let's get in the truck! I'll drive from here, Mr. Hat. Don't worry, Mr. Twig. Even though Mr. Hat rescued me from prison, I'm still gonna stick with you. It doesn't matter. He left me. Yes. But I feel like I'd be making the wrong decision. I'll never forget you, Mr. Twig. Thank you. No it isn't it makes you very sad. Now, apparently, the school board thinks that I don't teach you anything about current events, so tomorrow they're going to have you do presentations for the whole board. ""Current Events in South Park."" Now, I want you all to read a newspaper, or better yet, watch television, and come up with something current in South Park to do a report on. Now, this'll be a group project, so I'm going to place you all into groups of five. Let's see, uh. Wendy, Bebe, Clyde, Pip, and Token , you'll be Group 1, and Group 2 will be Stan, Kyle, Eric, Kenny, aaand, and Tweek. There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I bet he'll do a great job in your group. That's what Chad Everett thought when the new female intern joined the cast of Medical Center. He thought. ""Who is this woman with her gazungas and high heels? What does she know about medicine?"" Well, that intern soon saved Chad Everett's brother with a kidney transplant. So, you see? Well, let me put it another way. You have to give your oral report to the entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow! And if it doesn't kick ass, and you make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack you bitches up! I don't think they wrote this, Mr. Hat. Well, boys, it's obvious you didn't even-! Yes, great job. Yeah, well, I don't want to sound like a dickhole, but I told you so. Thank you, Mayor. I don't wanna sound like a dickhole, but I- Uh, boys, can I have a quick this and that with you? Boys, I don't know who wrote that report, but now that you've convinced everybody, you'd better stick with it. 'Cause if these people find out you didn't really write that paper, and I actually do get fired, then Mr. Hat is gonna do horrible things to you. Oh, not that, Mr. Hat! That's REALLY horrible! Anyway, good luck passing your new law, boys. That was close, Mr. Hat. Uh, boys, you better get your asses to work. They're expecting you to give a big speech on corporate takeovers, and this time it has to last five minutes. You little turds!! You've ruined my life for the last time!! Okay, children, we have a special guest today, a woman recruiting young people for a national choir tour. Now I know that choir tours are totally stupid and lame , but please, give her your full attention.  Go ahead. Eric Cartman, you say ""excuse me""! Go ahead. Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're spoken to!!  Go ahead. Kyle Broflovski, you watch your language!! Eric Cartman, you be nice to people!! Stan Marsh, you mind your manners!! Kenny McCormick, you pay attention!! Go ahead. All right, that does it!! Oh, here comes the guilt trip again. I, I do not know you, sir. And that, children, is what you need to know about The Facts Of Life. So, let's review.  Tootie left in the fourth season, but Blair and Jo stayed on and got husbands, leaving the fifth and sixth seasons hideously stagnant.  Okay children, that's lunch. See you in thirty minutes. Sure. Well children, I am your teacher. I think you'll find that my advice is just as valuable as Chef's, if not more so. Oh, the old succubus syndrome. A succubus is a woman sent from Hell to suck the life out of a man. Yeah, there's not much you can do about a succubus. Their evil power makes man blind to love. Yeah, I tell you boys, women can kill. Poontang's expensive. That's why when it comes to chicks, I just screw them and leave them. I'd say ""get out of my bedroom, poontang, before you suck my life dry!"" Sure, kids. Shut your hole, Mr. Hat! Hoh, wow! You don't see that every day! Poontang's poontang. And never let poontang come between you and your friend. I'll keep it at my house. What?! How dare you say that?! Oh, come on! You all know that pigeon was a total slut. Now, wait a minute. I wanna clear the air here. We all know that pigeon was a whore. Raise your hand if you didn't sleep with that pigeon?  Oh, whatever! Ho-okay, children, we have some new students joining us today. Let's all be warm and welcome them to our class. O-kay, so, we're just gonna stick to our normal lesson plan and start the day with history.  Now, does anyone know why Chubby Checker left the Beatles in 1972?  Yes? O-kay, is there anyone who can answer the question? Damnit, you don't raise your hand if you don't know! It sure is, Mr. Hat. Mayor, the little jakovasaurs are ruining my classroom. I can't teach our kids anything! Okay, chlidren. Let's take our seats. We have something very important to discuss. Due to recent events around the country I've been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school. Now, does anybody know what sexual harassment means?  Yes, Eric? ...No, Eric! That's not what I'm talking about! The school board has sent over a special guest to teach us all about sexual harassment in schools. Please welcome Petey, the Sexual Harassment Panda. Say ""hi"" to Sexual Harassment Panda! No, I had no freakin' idea! Of course, and so does Mr. Hat. We do not tolerate sexual harassment! I'm sorry, toots. Yes. Well, he is a little ass-sucker. Okay, baby, I'm sorry. Okay, children, there's a few changes being made here at school, but lessons will go on as normal. Any questions? Yes, Stan? Rright, ddesks. Well, a lot of cuts had to be made since the school's funding is short for lawsuits. Well, let's just try to cope with the changes and do our schoolwork. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence on the board, and I want you to tell me the noun. I know, I know. I'm sorry, children, but we can't afford chalk anymore. I have to write on the chalkboard with this rusty nail. Anyway, children, in the sentence, ""The ball is red..."" Okay, children, let's all take our seats. We have a lot to learn today.  Oohh-kay. Uh, Clyde, can you tell me when Ulysses S. Grant was president? Uh, Craig, how about you? Okay, children, I'm having a real problem with you all having lawyers! Ir is really disrupting class time!  Uh huh. Ri- oh, uh oh, I see. Oh, okay. Ri-ight. Kids, what I meant to say is that I fully condone you all having lawyers and support your legal recourses in every way. Now, let's get back to Ulysses S. Grant, if that's okay with you, uhum... Hey, it's Sexual Harassment Panda. He's right! Nothin' ever went wrong in this town before that evil KoRn band showed up. Okay, children, I want it quiet!  Now, we're gonna try this again until we get it right! What is 6 x 3? NO, GOD DAMNIT, IT'S 18! For the last time, my name is not Garrison-san, all right?! And this is not Hat-san! And you all better start talking in a manner that I can understand! What did he say?! Damnit, this is not Japan!! Aaaaah! I can't take it, Mayor. You have to put an end to this Chinpoko Camp. What? Well, uh-I guess that's true. You bet. I think Chinpokoman is chinpokorrific. I got Shoe. Hokay, children, we have a new student joining us from home school. Now, his parents are very worried about his safety, so please don't be too cruel to him. Mark? Alright, children, let's just try to pretend there isn't a little boy in a huge plastic hamster ball here, and go on with our studies. Now, who can tell me when Columbus sailed the seas and discovered America?  Ehyes, Mark? Because you never know the right answer, butt-for-brains! Yes, Mark? Well, very impressive, Mark. You should be able to throw the grading curve and flunk all these little bastards. Now, who can tell me what country Columbus was from?  Put your hand down, creampuff. Oh, please God, let it be forever. ...And so, children, that's why Hare Krishnas are totally gay.  Uh, can I help you? Oh, for Pete's sake, what have you bastards done now?! I hope you give them the chair!  Anyway, children, as I was saying, Hare Krishnas are totally gay. Mmm. It does taste like s'mores. Jimbo! Yeah! Why do we have to be their bitches every year?! You Yankee sons of bitches! That ain't true! The Confederates would have shupped ass in Topeka, too! I'll bet we could! That can't be. Oh no, I'm supposed to be at work today. Hey, guys. Let's all play a game of ""grab ass."" You know. We just run around in circles and try to grab each other's asses. Hohoho. Okay, children, let's take our seats. Today we're going to learn how different cultures around the world celebrate the holiday season. Now, pay attention. Ahem... Yeah yeah yeah, we've heard that crap for about 2000 years now! We wanna hear some'in' new! It's the year 2000, for Christ's sake! He's coming out! Well, I'd better book my ass a flight to Vegas! This sucks balls! Well, yeah, but that?? ...Well not like that! Hey, wait! That doesn't count as our question, does it?? Okay children, we've still got some time to practice the song before we load up the bus and head out for Oklahoma. Now, come on, there's gonna be over 4 million third-graders from all over the country there, and I wanna make sure South Park is the best! Okay?! Recorders up.  And a-1 and a-2 and a-  ""...of liberty."" You're late!  ""...my father-"" What the hell was that?!  God-damnit, I don't think you children have been working on your fingering! Shut up, Eric! There's gonna be 4 million children playing this song at the same time on their recorders, and, so help me God, South Park Elementary is not gonna be the only ones that don't know the song! Try again! Recorders up. And a-1 and a-2 and a- Sure, if you like the sound of a peacock getting its neck broken. Arkansas? Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you for a second? Mr. Mackey, um... I can't go to Arkansas. Somebody's gonna have to fill in for me. Arkansas is where I grew up. My parents live thereü¾³¤¼my  ...father still lives there. I haven't seen my father for 23 years. ...Some, yes. There was my uncle, Richard. He... he molested me. Saturday. Last, last Saturday. He's a paraplegic, but it didn'tü¾³¤¼ Don't look at me! Uh, y'all go on your bastard trip and just- don't look at me! Aaaaaah!  Huhh, ohh, I can do this. I have to do this. Hello. Dad. Can I ...come in? No. I don't think that will solve any of our problems, though you seem to think it did. I have a lot of demons that I need to face, father. I need to know some things. Alright, alright, let's just cut right to it!  I've come to ask you about the sexual abuse, dad! I have to know why! Right here and nowü¾³¤¼we're gonna talk about this! I know! I wanna know why not?! Was it that I was ugly?! I wasn't good enough for you! Was that it, dad?! Sure, you can go off and screw any whore on Wyland Street, but when it came to your own son you were just too busy! Yes. I hope it's okay if I stay here a few nights, Mother, I... I have some things I really need to talk to you about. Mother, did you know that ...Dad... never sexually molested me? He never did, Mom, not once. He never did, Mom! And I think you knew he never did! You stood by and let it happen! You saw him come home drunk and then just go right to sleep! Face it, Mother. He never abused me! Mother won't hear the truth! You can't close your eyes forever, Mother! Mother, wait! Well, Mom said I could sleep in the guest room tonight. Good night, Dad. Guess I'll just... go on up to bed now. Now, I don't really have any pajamasü¾³¤¼guess I'll just... sleep in my boxers or something. Uh I'll leave the door open a little in case you ...need to see me about anything. I'll just... be going up to bed now. Gueh... guess maybe I won't even uhwear those boxers. You don't love me!  I wanna die! Dad?  Pop, I'm just fast asleepü¾³¤¼I'm not hearing anything. Oh! Oh! Oh, Dad! Oh, goodness gracious, uh! Oh, stop Dad, stop! Whahawah, whah, how could you-hoo?! Well, Mom, Dad, I guess I'd better be going. The concert is gonna start soon. No, I... think all my work here is done. Dad, I... don't know what to say; I feel closer to you than I ever have. We sure can! Well, I've got a worldwide-telecast recerder concert to get to. I will.  Good-bye, Mom! Good-bye, Dad! Gray skies are gonna clear up; put on a happy face... Oh, no. What are they doing? Coem on, boys. You're holdin' up the bus.  Oh, wow, look. It's Kenny G himself. Thank you for a wonderful concert, Mr. G. Okay, children, I hope you all did your homework last night, because we're goin' to talk about pages 42 through 612. First of all, who can tell me what year the Founding Fathers got together? Let's see, how about... Wendy? Good job, Wendy. And what was that document called? Kyle? Very good, Kyle. Now, who can tell me what famous person wrote the Declaration of Independence?  Let's see. Oh, I know. How about the new student, Timmy? Nno, it wasn't you, Timmy. Try again. Timmy, did you not do your homework?! Don't call people names, Stanley! Now, Timmy,ü¾³¤¼ ü¾³¤¼You need to work on your study skills! Are you mocking me?! Because if you are, I have no problem sending your butt to the principal's office! THAT DOES IT! Hurry up, children, let's take our seats. You'd better have done your homework last night, Timmy.  What's this? A note from the principal? ""Please excuse Timmy from all questions and all homework, as he has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder.""  Oh, brother! That's just swell, Timmy! Looks like you've outsmarted the principal and the counselor! Very well, I guess you're excused from homework. Okay, children, let's settle down! Huhh I mean it; I want quiet!  My God, Mr. Hat, these children are so boring on Ritalin.  Huh, ah! Alright, children, today we're gonna learn about human reproduction. What do you think about that?!  Vaginas, and penises. Butt sex. Well, damnit, Eric, don't you have some smartass thing to say?! This is driving me crazy!! I can't handle you little bastards being so mellow!! Haah! Eric! Oh, crap! Huh-uh, nothing! Nothing! Hey uh, uh, uh. Good thing you guys came. This... little boy was trying to have his way with me. No-o! I'm telling you, this is all a terrible mistake, Officer Barbrady. O-ogh! Eat me, pervert! I did not want love from a young boy! I like men my own age.  Aah! I mean, I like women! What did I say?-Oh God! I love titties! Aw, damnit, I'm in the wrong place. What?? Well, who cares about a guy that makes beer?! Jesus Christ, I'm trying to teach history! Oh, whatever! That was not me, that was Mr. Hat! Gentlemen, teaching is all I know. It is the air that I breathe. Very well. I guess... I'm not a teacher anymore.  I suppose you'll be wanting my badge and gun... Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then? I don't know what I'm goin' tuh do, Mackey. Teaching is all I know. I've always wanted to write a novel. But I never know what to write about. Besides teaching? ...Poontang. I can't help it. I'm a womanizer sometimes, I know, but I just think that... taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world. Yes, that's it.  I am going to write the Great American Romance Novel!  MR. GARRISON  MR. GARRISON Yeahyeahyeah. So, didi you read the book? Well, what did you think? Ooohhh, why not?? Well, I'm sure there's lots of naughty words. It is a romance novel. No? What the hell are you talkin' about?! Well, I thought it was mostly women that read these things! Well, women want to read about ding-dongs! D'you thnk women care about the details of female anatomy?! Hel-lo! Women wanna read about big, poweful schlongs!  Look, I've seen women read these things. They skim along and skim along until they get to the part about the penis! That's what they want, so that's what I'm giving them! Oh, here's everybody. Boys, I have an announcement to make: I'm not gonna be your teacher anymore. I've become a best-selling author! And Kyle, I want you to have a signed copy as a get-well present. NO, no,  but Mr. Hat is. Ogh! You're such a racist bastard, Mr. Hat. Oohh, I'm sorry, Chef. Mr. Hat is a racist son of a bitch. Dugh!  Ogh. Waaaaah! Mr. Hat, what do you think you're doing? Ooh no, Mr. Hat. You are not dragging to another Klan meeting. Well, good for you, Puppet Pants! I'll have nothin' to do with it! Oh yeah?!  I'm not going, Mr. Hat, and that's final!  Let's just see you try and go without me!  Mi-Mr. Hat? Iii'mmm nnnooottt gggaaayyy!!! Who-? Who are you? What do you want? No! No, I... haven't... taught in over... eight... months. Do you know what it is to be a teacher, Ms....? No I don't!  IT'S A LIE! You see? That's what you get for bein' a teacher! You work and you work for the children and then people start rumors that you're gay even though you love poontang! ...Two hundred bucks. Alright, let's try it again. ""But teacher, I don't want to do my math problems."" ""Well, I'm not gong' to do it, teacher! You can just suck my balls!"" NOOO! Look, you can't counter a profane command with an idle threat! You must extingish it with a vulgar suggestion! When a child says, ""Suck my balls,"" you say, ""Present them."" Now, let's try it again.  SUCK MY BALLS! Good.  Very good.  You're ready to move on to the next level. But I warn you: we will now be diving deep into your own psyche. These children know what scares you, and so we, too, must face those demons. You will be! You will be!  You wil be. This is it: The Tree of Insight. You must go in and face what lives inside. Hel if I know. I wouldn't go in there. Hey, hurry up in there!  Jesus.  You're taking too long in the damn Tree of Insight!  You in there?!  Hey, where the hell did she go?  What the?  Haaa! Who? Who are you? Ey, guess what everybody?! I'M GAY!!! I'm as gay as a gymnast on shore leave! Okay, children, let's take our seats. My name is Mr. Garrison. And I'm the new kindergarten teacher. I used to be the third grade teacher, but I had a little  ""nervous breakdown"" and went into the mountains where I lived off of  ""rat carcasses""  But I'm all better now, and the school was nice enough to let me g n teaching, as long as it was for kindergarten.  But it's not a demotion. No. I mean, just because a teacher was teaching third grade and now is teaching kindergarten, that's not a demotion, is it?  No, that's right, it's not. Well, let's start with role call. Uh, let's see. Filmore Anderson? Sally Bands? Alright, Ike Broflovski. Broflovski --- I had your older brother Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too. Well that's bad news for everybody else, because I will be grading you all on a curve. Aaand that's how the relationship with my father sort of ended. There's still some sort of skeletons in the closet, but things between us are a little better. Okay, children, well now it's time for us to elect a class president , so first we must pick nominees.  Who would like to nominate someone? Okay, Filmore.  You'll be our first nominee. And who else?  Yes, Jenny. In a minute, Jenny. Who else wants to nominate a class presdient?  Oh, come on! You can't have an election with just one person running! What's the fun in that? Ike? How about you? You're a genius. Okay, our second nominee is Ike The Genius.  Okay, children, now we'll hear briefly from each nominee. Filmore, why don't you go first? Very enthralling. Okay, Ike? How about you? ...Well, this is gonna be a tough one, kids. So that's six votes for Filmore and six votes for Ike.  And the last vote is for... uh, let's see. Flora, I can't tell who you voted for.  You've got the winning vote, Flora. Who d'you pick? Flora, you have to pick one: Filmore or Ike. Oh, great! Flora's undecided! Well, you're just gonna have to sit there, Flora, and think about it until you come up with an answer. Oh, for Christ's sakes, you're all acting like a bunch o' kids! Oh, thank God, Flora!  Alright, who do you vote for? Okay, so then the total is six for Filmore and now seven votes for Ike. Ike is the new class persident. What? Oh, of all the juvenile things I've ever heard! You LOST, Filmore! Don't be such a baby!  Alright, alright, I'll count up the ballots again. Okay, we had one vote for Filmore...  ...And this time, I again get six votes for Filmore and seven votes for Ike! NO, children! I've recounted 106 times now and I keep coming up with seven to six! Except in the one instance where it came out seven to five, and one where it came out twelve to fourteen. IT'S OVER! IKE IS CLASS PRESIDENT! Oh, will you grow up?! Jesus! Alright, we'll wait for tomorrow so the absent kid can cast his vote! Now go home! Alright children, as you know, we've been waiting for the absent kid's ballot to come in. Well, his mother was nice enough to bring him in from the hospital so that he could cast his vote. Ms. Harris? Thank you very much, Billy. Don't forget to pick up your lung.  Alright, the absent kid's ballot is for...  Fillmore. Oh, Jesus Tapdancing Christ! There's a box next to Filmore's name and a box next to Ike's! What's not to understand?! Who's your famous aunt? Your aunt Rosie O'Donnell is coming here? Oh no! What the hell is that?  Oh my God! What is that thing?! Children, there's some huge bulbous monstrosity heading for the classroom!  Oh my God, it's awful! It's coming for the door. Run for your lives, children!  I'll try to fight it off! Oh. Oh, um. Pleasure to meet you, Miss O'Donnell. You're looking... well. Look, it's very simple. We took a vote and the vote tied, so now we gotta come up with a way- Oh, STOP IT, STOP STOP IHIHIHIHIT! Look kids, we're all in this kindergarten class together. We have to respect one another or else we're in for a terrible school year. Half the kids in the class didn't vote for your nephew, so what about them? You don't give a crap about them because they're not on your side! People like you preach tolerance and open-mindedness all the time, but when it comes to Middle America, you think we're all evil and stupid country yokels who need your political enlightenment!! WELL, JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TV DOESN'T MEAN YOU KNOW CRAP ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT!!! NOW GET YOUR ASS BACK ON FIRST CLASS AND RESPECT THIS CLASS'S RIGHT TO MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS!!!  ...Oh, sorry I got a little off the subject, kids. Oh no, children, I think I've just made this a whole lot worse. Okay, children, the lawyers for Ike's side have agreed with the lawyers on Filmore's side to hold another meeting regardng Form 22F. Do we all have that form? Jesse Jackson? We don't have any African-Americans in our class! Alright, so apparently what we're gonna do now is hand-count each person's ballot- You... yuh, you what? Ohuh. Yes.  Yes! Let's fingerpaint! Hello, parents, and welcome to the 13th annual South Park Thanksgiving Pageant. And now, here it is. The touching story of Helen Keller, ""The Miracle Worker."" And finally tonight, parents, we have the South Park Kindergarten class. Their play is titled, ""Thanksgiving, Mon Ami."" Alright, see you next year, parents. It's called intervention, Eric. Yeah, except for me. I just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you. But that's not the question. Hey everybody, it's on in thirty minutes! Oh, I bet this is it! Here it comes... And so, children, instead of saying ""Hand in your papers,"" I may now say ""Hand in your shit."" Any questions? NO! NO, Filmore! You can say ""I have to poop and shit,"" or ""Oh, shit, I have to poop,"" but NOT ""I have to shit."" Are we all clear? Look, it's all about context. Well, for example, recently, I have come out and admitted that I was a homosexual. I'm gay. That means that now I can say the word, ""fag."" On television they usually don't allow ""fag."" But because I'm gay, it's alright. And with the new approval of the word, ""shit,"" that means that finally I am free to say, Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag, Hey, watch it, fag. I called you a fag. Because I'm gay, and that means I'm free to use the word ""fag."" So piss off, you fag-shitter! Well, they can't use ""fag."" Because you can't say ""fag"" unless you're a homosexual. No. See, you got beeped. That's right. Well well well! Guess we learned something new about you, Jimbo, you freakin' fag! You wanna make out or something? Oh boy, this show is really reaching for plot now! Is this still part of the show? Hey, you're the guy on the screen. Eric, that is a lot of money. Don't you think you should keep it in the bank instead of at your hosue? Okay, children, who can tell me what a condom is?  Yes, Jenny? That's a con-dor, Jenny. Con-dor.  Con-doms are what we use to stop the spread of STDs.  Yes, Filmore? NO, we can't do fingerpaint! You kids wanna get herpes?! Huh?! How about a nice bucket of AIDS?! Sound good?! Now pay attention, alright? I'm going to show you the proper way to put on a condom.  First of all you remove the condom from its package.  Then you find which way the condom rolls out.  Put it in your mouth...  And apply.  And it's as simple as that. Any questions? Okay, children, now I wanna review the different sexual positions. Who can tell me which sexual positions we talked about? Missionary position, good. A little boring, but tried and true. What else? That's right. Doggie style we went over, mhm. Uh huh, pile driver position. Good, Quaid. Yes, good Flora, you remembered the Filthy Sanchez. Yes,you can give your partner the ol' Hot Karl, sure. Jesus Christ. Wha? Why did you pan to me just now? What the hell is that s'posed to mean? What the? Oh alright, have your way with me if you must! Go on, fulfill you sick pleasures! Huh where are you goin'? Wow, I never realized Ben had TPS, but I definitely see the resemblance now. But you work for the-  uh, God-damnit!! Oh, I feel like I've run a marathon. What? Well of course I didn't make it. The line to check in was two hours long, and the security line was two hours more! I can't go tomorrow, the Jizzfest is tonight! This is unbelievable! You know, I seem to remember when the airlines said, ""We need a 15 billion dollar bailout from the taxpayers-""! Well we gave them the 15 billion dollar bailout and they fired their employees anyway! So now we have three people to clear 400 passengers! So where did that money go? I'll tell you where it went: it went into the pockets of the preseidents and CEOs of the airlines, so they can keep their miltimillion dollar salaries! You think you can treat us however you want because we HAVE to fly! Well I'll tell you what, Sally Sassalot, I'm gonna come up with a NEW mode of transportation! A ahah brand new vehicle that'll put all you bastards out of business! You think I can't do it?! I got a master's degree in mechanical engineering at Denver Community College! You watch me!!  Come on, everybody! Now it's got to be simple. Like a moped, but with the ability to travel at much faster speeds. The designs of our electrical moped were altered with a- no, nonono this won't work either! It has to be more stable, Mr. Hat! A moped would be too dangerous at those speeds. Damnit!  Now, what if the jet power of an aircraft could be scaled down into a personal vehicle? Oh, Mr. Hat! Would you stop drooling over Enrique Iglesias and... wait a minute. What did you say? That's it. Gyration.  A gyrascope. It would allow for maximum balance and yet... Mr. Hat! You're a genius!  It's so simple and yet genius! We've done it, Mr. Hat. Airline companies be damned. We've invented a whole new mode of transportation! Get some investors on the phone!  Well what are you waiting for?! Gentlemen, imagine being able to travel safely at incredibly fast speeds, and not having to go to the stupid fartface airports! It IS incredible, Mr. Hat. And what makes IT possible  is IT's patented gyroscope design.  Gentlemen, I give you, IT! IT gets over 300 miles to the gallon, and is safely capable of speeks of over 200 miles per hour. Now, IT is easily operated using four flexigrip handles. Two of them are on each side. Left side for throttle, right side for steering.  The third flexigrip is gently inserted into the anus, to keep the driver in place. ...there we go. Now, the final flexigrip is directly in front of the driver so that its small switches can be operaterd with the mouth, as such.  Put the four together and we're ready to go. :	 Okay, good. Just step through here And then this is your steering and here's your throttle. Okay, now you're just gonna feel a little pinch. It's alright, it's just locking you in.  You can take it.  Doing great, Kathy. How's that ride?  Okay, now use your mouth to operate the turn signals, and you're off.  Great! Who else wants to give it a spin? We're in the money, Mr. Hat, We're in the money, Mr. Hat...  Oh hi, Jimbo. Can I help you? Oh, right, right. Take a seat. What do you think, Mr. Marsh? All set to put a down payment on that baby? Sure. Yeup. Right. Well, I... guess you could. Excuse me, what the hell are you doing? Shutting me down? Why? Yeah, well that was the point, dingleberry! Ah-t put that down! OH, GOD-DAMNIT! You'd better be kidding! THE AIRLINE COMPANIES ARE LOSING MONEY BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN INCOMPETENCE AND THEIR OWN INEFFICIENCY!! HWAAAAHHH! Airline motherfuckerrrs! You pieces of shiiit! Cocksucking sons of bitch airlines! Look, there's more of them moving into our town.  You know, Oprah Winfrey is building a house up on Cannon, and some Snoop Doggy Doo Doo buildin' a gigantic place up on Main. That's the fifth family of them that's moved here. Seems like all of a sudden South Park is being overrun by those types. Yiou know, those types! Rich people! Oh, yeah, and it won't be long before they drove all of us poor underachieving people out of town with inflated real-estate costs! Yeah.  Hey, rich guy!  Hey, Richie Rich! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you, richer! What's in the huge box, richer?! Your checkbook? Yeah. Hey, hey, you guys know why richers have such big garages? 'Cause they need a place for all their Porsches and boats and aircraft carriers!  Yeah, that's right, cashchucker! Go have fun with your two million dollar house! Those richers are getting snooty. We've got to show those richers they're not welcome here! How about tonight, we sneak up to one of their houses, and right on their lawn we'll set fire to a big lowercase t! Yeah, for ""time to leave""! Jimbo, you take some folk and build a big wooden lowercase t! I'll take the rest and get some gas and torches ready! Alright! T is for ""time to leave,"" cashchucker! Now, come on! Is that any way to talk? No! We just haven't scared them the right way! Think about it. What scares rich people more than anything? Bingo! Rich people don't want to live in South Park if they think it's HAUNTED! Everyonen get some sheets from home! If we can't chase the richers out, we'll spook 'em out! That's great! And now we can sell all their homes, and become... millionaires! And so, we will all miss Kenny, his playful laughter, his innocent smile. But we will never forget that it was because of brave Kenny that stem-cell research was allowed to continue. Well, that's four fingers; try five. ...Who is that?! Hell no! I've been savin' this spot for six hours! There he is, beatin' that dead horse! Cuh-can you imagine what we thought when you said, ""Aides for Everyone Foundation""? Then it's time! We can undo the banner! ""AIDS quilt"" Butters, have you seen Mr. Hat? ...What the hell's wrong with him? That is very impressive, Eric. What do you intend to do with your underwater society? What's going on now? A ladder to heaven? That's fuckin' stupid. I'm aware of that. Wow, that's... really great to hear. Oh, for real? You're not kidding? Hoh, this is all just... this is a dream come true!  Thank you, Principal Victoria! I'll do a great jub! You're sure this is for real? I mean, I'm not gonna just get fired again for being gay tomorrow. Oh-ho, great! Right uh-  Wha- ...what was that? ...Oh right, right, right, I... Huh-... how much money, exactly? Yeh-you don't say.  Well thanks, uh, Principal Victoria.  Holy Moley! I've gotta find a way to get fired for being gay! Thank you, Mr. Mackey. Okay, children, now for those of you whoare new, my name is  Mr. Garrison. Well, I was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for Mr. Hat. But it's okay because I found a new teacher's assistant. Say hello to... Mr. Slave. So that's  Mr. Slave.  The teacher's assitant.  Or, as I like to write for short, the Teacher's Ass. Okay, Mr. Slave. Go sit until I need you. I'm not saying the rest of the school year will be easy. In fact, it's going to be long and hard.  Really long and really hard. Eheh, the first thing we're gonna be learning about is communist Russia. Now, Stalin was a big silly when it came to... Eric, did you just throw a paper airplane?! Very funny, Eric! Kenny's dead! That does it! I will not put up with foolishness in my class! It's time for punishmenmt!  Take it Mr. Slave! I will  NOT put up with  TOMfoolery in my  CLASSroom, children.  Mr. Slave, put this rubber ball in your mouth. Take that, Slavey! take it!  This'll get me fired for sure. Okay, children, let's take our seats. Uh, apparently, none of you tried to get me fired yesterday, so I guess we're just gonna have to go on and learn more today.  Now who can tells me what happens to water when we heat it up in the Bunsen burner? Good, Butters. Now if we take the glass tube of the Bunsen burner, we can also see how other things react.  Evaporation is an exothermic reaction, so let's look at an endothermic one. Mr. Slave, position 7 please.  Now I'm gonna put the glass tube under Mr. Slave's tight ass.  The heat from Mr. Slave's ass will act as our new conductor of energy Okay, now Butters, could you bring over Lemmiwinks for me please? Newton was the first to discover that for every action there's a reaction - thank you Butters. Now what do you think is gonna happen when I introduce the element of the gerbil to the endothermic heat of Mr. Slave's ass?  Well let's see. That was a brilliant idea, having me put a gerbil up your ass, Mr. Slave. Now we'll get fired for sure! That's it! They're gonna fire me for being gay! Twenty-five million here we cooome. You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria? Oh dear, sounds like I'm gettin' fired. Oh no, you're firing me? Oh well, I can't stop being who I am. I can't help the way God made me. Guess I just have to go. ...You're not? Yeah! God-damnit! This is unbelievable, Mr. Slave! It seems no matter what I do I can't get fired! No! The parents felt so bad that their kids didn't want to attend my class anymore that they wanna give me the Courageous Teacher award this Friday at the Museum of Tolerance! I mean, I stuck a gerbil up your ass and they wanna give me a Goddamn medal! Oh well-  Hey, that's right, Mr. Slave. The parents have to see for themselves. The awards ceremony! Well we'll put on a show they'll never forget! There! I've done it, Mr. Slave. The perfect plan to get us fired. You finished your costume design yet? What's the matter? Well here, take a Pepto pill. I can't have my teacher's ass under the weather. Get along, little Slave. Ding-ding, ding-ding. Say, Mr. Slave. I had a dream last night that you were a real dick. No no, I was the asshole. Uh, I uh I'm very happy to get this award. Uh but you know what makes me even happier? Sucking balls. It isn't working. Sing your song, Mr. Slave. Uh... God-damnit, don't you people get it?! I'm trying to get fired here! Look, this kind of behavior should not be acceptable from a teacher! Tolerant, but not stupid! Look, just because you have to tolerate something doesn't mean you have to approve of it! If you had to like it, it'd be called the Museum of Acceptance!  ""Tolerate"" means you're just putting up with it! You tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or, or you tolerate a bad cold. It can still piss you off! Jesus Tapdancing Christ! Ogh! Okay, so now can I PLEASE get fired and get my 25 million dollars?! Well this is insane! Oh no. What an inspiration. Okay children, let's take our seats. Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the counselor wants to see you in his office, now. Okay, let's all take out our math homework and go over the problems. Oh, and by the way, children, there's a walkout scheduled today to protest the war in Iraq. So, uh, if you're against the war, run along outside, and if you're for the war, uh, stay here and we'll do math problems. Well, I hope you little Commies are pretty pleased with yourselves!  Going out there and protesting America, and then saying on national television that you don't even know who the Founding Fathers are! You kids don't know squat about America, do you?! Well that's just jingles! Because I'm assigning all you little flag-burners a full report on seventeen seventy-siyix, and the Founding Fathers! SHUT UP! I want you all in your study groups of four, and if you can't give an outstanding report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about all this protesting, then it's Fs for you! Olay, children, let's take our seats. If you'll remember yesterday we were discussing state capitals. Butters, will you pay attention, please? Will you kids shut up?  Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are not-! Oh my God, that's Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck. Well what are we waiting for? Let's get outside! And so you can see, children, that the women's movement of the late fifties and the early sixties had a profound effect on feminism in America.  Uh, boys!  Would it trouble you terribly not to sleep in my class? Oh well, then maybe you can tell me who was in charge of the feminist movement of the early sixties! Right, but who was the fattest oldest skank on her period?!  That's what I thought! Now pay attention!  Okay, children, now, the biggest fatass was an old skank by the name of- Oh my God. Yeah.  So long, South Park. We can save the town and be super-rich! Well, this is it, Mr. Slave. We're officially homeless. Sorry, Charlies! You can just keep your filthy bastard Indian money! Uh oh, right, huh. Sorry about that. We're not moving, assfaces! You had me at ""free blanket."" All right children, let's take our seats. Well, uh d-don't you all look nice. What the hell is going on?? Oh, stop it!! You kids don't even know what you're talking about!! Eric, you're not half-bi!! WHAT?? It was the crazies thing I've ever seen, Mr. Slave. All the children were suddenly acting like being gay was cool. I mean, maybe we're not the only gay couple in town anymore. Look at that, Mr. Slave.  Our cup runneth over. Thanks, Jimbo. I really like your outfit, too.  Soho... so Jimbo, you... wanna come back to my place with me and Mr. Slave? Well, you know... Huh. Oh hey Randy. Wull thanks. You too.  So uh, Randy, you want me to give you a hand job in the bathroom? Not, not like that? Uh-OH, thanks, Mr. Tweek. Oh, wuh, welluh, Mr. Tweek, why don't we uh, go back to my place. Well, you know, I was just thinking we could... put on some music and watch videos and pound Mr. Slave's tight little ass. Straight? Bu-uh, Oh what... Jesus, what the hell is goin' on here?! Why won't anybody pound Mr. Slave's butt?! Those pants and those shoes say you pound butt!! No, your shoes say you take it in the butt!! One of you?!  We've spent our whole lives tryin' NOT to be one of you! You can't do this to us!! Chef, can I talk to you? Thanks. Come, Slave.  Oh, it's just awful, Chef! I used to feel like an outsider, a totally different person who stood out in this town! Now every straight guy is acting gayer than me! Chef, what did you do when white people stole your culture? We don't have time for all that, Chef! Oh, if only those Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people understood what they were doing.  Wait.  That's it! I know exactly what to do!  Come on, Mr. Slave! Let's get back to our flippity floppity floop. Kyle, what are you doing here? What?? That's what I'm doing! They took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours! No you didn't! No you didn't! I thought of it yesterday! I thought of it before you were born! Oh.  You're right, Mr. Slave. We can both kill them together. Room service. Oh, well, the woman at the front desk sent it up. Okay, Mr. Slave! Well crap, that didn't work. Look, guys, we're sorry we tried to murder you, but... You have to stop what you're doing! But don't you see the price? You're selling out your own kind. Look, us gays have created a lifestyle, a, a culture that is uniquely ours. If we keep trying to make straight people into us, well, we're gonna have no identity left. Buh... but... this doesn't make sense! How can gay men do this to their own people??  Unless... you're not gay at all... Oh my God. Gone?? I knew it! I knew gay people would never do this to their own kind! Stop them! They're crab people! You bastards! Yes! They were tryingn to systematically make men into wusses so they could take over the world! So now, can you please change your network's programming? Look out!! And so you see, children, Genghis Khan was a ""Mongol,"" not to be confused with a ""mongoloid"" like the actor, Nicholas Cage. Okay now, who can tell me in what ...year ...the ...first ...film by a... mongoloid...  That's odd.  Those ROTC guys are way off course. Stay in your seats, children. I'll be right back. Uh, can I help you folks find something? Oowww! Gary was state champion in wrestling AND in tennis.  He also maintained a 4.0 grade point average at his old school AND has been on two national commercials for toothpaste. All right, Gary, why don't you take that empty seat and we'll get started with the lesson? Okay now, who can tell me what year the first astronauts landed on the moon? Very good, Gary. Wow, looks like I don't have a class full of retards anymore, doesn't it, children? Here he comes! What'd he say? Hey Mr. Reiner, why don't you Butt Out! All right, kids! Out on the gym floor for P.E. class. How about, we get rid of all the Mexicans? Rats! All right, folks, our next item up for bids is this lovely 19th Century lamp You see the damage you've caused, Eric Cartman?! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?! I could only imagine the rage building inside you, Stan. I bet you can't wait to outdance those OC bastards! Aww yeah. Yeah! All right, children, the school board has mandated that I must now teach class in both present-day English and Futurespeak. So, with that in mind, let's continue our lessons on verbs. Remember that there are transitive verbs such as ""The boy threw the red ball,"" which in Futurespeak of course, is  Everyone say it with me?  Aaand there are intransitive verbs, such as  ""The 11:15 bus from Denver arrived twelve hours late."" Or in Futurespeak, ""Vvut."" Thank you, aging hippie liberal douche. Okay, now let's get back to it, kids. What kind of verb is this?  ""The sad girl puts balls in her mouth."" Or, in Futurespeak of course, ""Gluch gligh balls glych gligh."" Oh Jesus, not PETA again. All right, children, I have just been informed that since our school has been attacked by eco-terrorists for the 47th time, we are going to change our school mascot. That's right, Stanley, the eco-terrorists win.  Now, I have here a mascot selection sheet. Every student is supposed to check the box next to the mascot they like the most. And the most popular selection will be the school's new mascot. Get, get outta here, PETA! We're changin' the mascot already! Go on, get, get outta here!  Get, get out!  Jesus, where do they keep coming from??  Go on, get outta here. Now children, it's not that bad. There's plenty of great new mascots on the sheet to chose from. The Hurricanes, the Blizzards, the Redskins, the Indians... No, those are fine. PETA doesn't care about people. Attention students, we have tallied your mascot nomination sheets, and there will now be a school-wide vote between the top two nominations. So here is the first most-requested candidate, a giant douche. And now your second nominee, Turd Sandwich. Students can now cast their choice between the Giant Douche and the Turd Sandwich. We'll count up the votes on Tuesday. Hey everybody, it's time!  It's time! Get down to Metzger's Field! It's about to happen! It's like we're a real town now. Well what are you doing here, Randy? Let's burn it down! Boys, you did it! You killed the Wall*Mart! Oh, looks like somebody else is doin' a little partyin' tonight. Oh yeah, sure, you're just buyin' that for your bad coughs, right?  Us too. Oh, hello Wendy. Are you all right? From from me? Well sure, come on in. Mr. Slave is right over here. Mr. Slave, little Wendy from class wants to see you. Give him time, Wendy. Give him time. Come on, Mr. Slave. Now, that's a whore! Sorry, Eric, but if Kyle feels discriminated against, you'll have to stop or else I'll get a call from his mother. God bless you, Doctor. I know you'll make me well again. My whole life I've been a woman trapped in a man's body. A sex-change operation is my last chance at happiness. Ough, ergh. Eww. So long, balls. Oh, that stings. OH! Oh jeez. Do I look like a woman?"
"MR. HAT","That's right Mr. Garrison. Christopher Columbus discovered America, and was the Indians best friend. He helped the Indians win their war against Frederick Douglas, and, and freed the Hebrews from Napoleon, and discovered France. You can say that again, Mr. Garrison. Gosh Mr. Garrison, this sure is exciting! Have you forgotten about all the pain and suffering that Kathy Lee Gifford caused you? We could have WON that talent show... We could have been huge! Who's there? Orange who? Thank you. But now she's coming to South Park... And I know a way to make it ALL better! Kill her. KILLLLLLLLLL... She'll make a fool of you again. It happened again, didn't it? Now we do things MY WAY. THE BITCH MUST DIE!!! Well, I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids. WE CAN STILL GET HER!! MMFF MF!! Well how about Stan, our little South Park quarterback star? Life isn't fair, kiddo, get used to it. Yeah, why the hell is that little Jewish kid playing quarterback?! Yeah, we all put our lives' savings in this game! That's right, Mr. Garrison, Genetic Engineering is an exciting new science. You can splice the DNA from some animals and make them better. Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering let's us correct God's horrible, horrible mistakes... like German people. You know you boys might want to visit the genetic engineering ranch outside of town for some help. And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month. I'm your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan. You can tell me ANYTHING. Now, who hits you? Is it your father or your mother? Watching that show is bad, Mr. Garrison. (WOOKIE GROWL) That's right Mr. Garrison, Englbert Humperdink was the first person on the moon, who was second? It sure is, Mr. Garrison. I think it looks great! You can say that again, Mr. Garrison! You can say that again, Mr. Garrison! Oh, just one more Cosmopolitan Mr. Garrison. I SURE DID MR. GARRISON!!! WHAT A RETARD!!! Yes, conjucate the verb. That's right, Mr. Garrison. The Vietnam War was sticky and icky. You're not fooling anyone! This is insane, Mr. Garrison. Mr. Garrison isn't here right now. Oh, good one, Sherlock! You figure that out all by yourself?! No! No, you moron!  Mr. Garrison can't let the memories end! Just leave us alone! Why would he want to talk to a second-rate dopey-ass elementary-school psychologist?! You heard me, jackass! There's monkeys that make better counselors than you! White Power! White Power! Don't apologize for me to that spearchucker! There's another Klan rally tonight; I have to be there in 15 minutes. But they're electing a new assistant to the Grand Dragon. I might get elected. I'm going whether you like it or not! What was wrong with that plan? Boy, that Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass around. I said Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass! Check out his hot bulge, too. That sounds incredible, Mr. Garrison."
"MR.HAT","Well Kyle, NO! You hear me? You go to hell, you go to hell and you die!"
"PIP","OWWWW!!!!! Ah, Mr. Chef, sir? Well I still don't have a helmet. Yes, but, couldn't we ROTATE who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me? Oh. Ah, Mr. Chef, sir? Right-o... But how about I'll use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without. Um, no... I guess not. Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet? Yes, I'll pay $50 for one. 'Allo gentlemen. Any of you blokes know what's for lunch today? Lunchie munchies Hmmm? Well, my father's family name being Pirrip and my Christian name Phillip, my infant tongue -- Right-o. PIIIINK EYYYEEE... PIIIINK EYYYEEE... Oh Eric, I didn't get an invitation. Oh, good day, Damien! My name is Phillip, but everyone calls me 'Pip'... Because they hate me. Right-o. Oh dear, you shouldn't be so upset, Damien. I know its hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you some day. Believe me, I know what its like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor, he helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely. Oh, nice try! A little higher and you've got it. Good day. How are you, Damien? Fart boy? Oh good, perhaps they won't call ME that any more! Yes... It's always such a huge event. Sometimes I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there. Oh, yes. Actually, I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too, but now I think they like him because he picks on me. Yes, I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but -- Oh NOOOO!!!!!! Oh, what a splendid party. Yes I'll pay fifty dollars for one! OOH! OOH! I think I found one!! Oh, I do believe I found it first. Oh, dear... What do you mean? Oh, my. Well, I suppose if I must... Well, I guess you win. Uuh. Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I don't believe I know how to play dodgeball. Well, no. And actually, I'm not from France- Oh, dear. Oh, what jolly good fun! Ugh. On, no, I couldn't. I'm not French- Ogh! I'm dreadfully sorry! I'd love to! Hey! I get quite disturbed when you call me that! You shouldn't make fun of foreigners!  And besides, I hate French people! Oh, bother. Gaaah! Gaaah! Aaaaaaaaah! Everyone! Everyone, look! I won the game! We're world champions! Mr. Chef, Mr. Chef. South Park is the world champion in dodgeball. Oh, glorious day! Did you all see? I can't believe I threw such a ball with my own arm. It was- Where did everybody go? Oh! Have a good summer, gentlemen! Right-o. Uh. Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you? Welluh I have to spend my summer in summer school. Because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead. I won! Cheerio, Stahan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here. We were just playing a game called Wickershams and Ducklers. Do you want to play? I'm the head Wickerknicker. And you are all little Wickershams  We all sing the merry tune of Stratford until I yell, ""Turrah!"" and then you all fall down laughing, and I join you, as I find it funny too. Stan, would you be the Wickersham of Brumble Briar?  And all right, here we go. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. Wickersham tally-ho ugh.  Are you sure you don't want to play, Stanley? Hey, look at this! It's a box filled with ladies' clothes. Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I? Oh, this sounds as much fun as Wickershams and Ducklers! Come on, Angels. Let's get dressed.  Which ladies' garments would you like, Stan? Well.  Alrighty then. Okay, Angels, what's our mission this week? Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission. Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us? Oh, that's a splendid mission! Bosley! Bosley! Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels. Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs. So Bosley, what's our next mission? We did it! Great job, Angels! What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley? Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission? Oh dear. We've angered Bosley. Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits. Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission. But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again. Now what do we do? I was archery-class esquire at Stratfordshire. I think that's got it. Did I do a nice job? Really? O-hoh, I believe we've saved the day! There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job. But, if I say that, you'll hit me. Please, hit me. Ooowww! Oh, my goodness! Oh, that's a wonderful idea. This is a sad day for men everywhere. Let's all hear it for Cartman's big, fat ass!  Oh-ff. 'Ello Mom. 'Ello Dad. It certainly is nice to see you again.  Don't worry. Sister is still taking very good care of me. She just loves to smack me in the face and tell me I'm worthless. O, we have such fun together.  But it's getting dark, Mom and Dad. I'll see you again soon.  Wa-a-ah! Oh, hello. Why, you look like an escaped convict. Did we breaky-wakys out of prison?  Oh dear! But you're shackled. Here, let me help you. I'm an apprentice blacksmith.  There you are.  And here's a sandwich. You must be starving! Well, it's not for me to judge you, sir. We are all the same.  Don't quite outmart this thing, I'm afraid. Waaah!  Lovely day, isn't it? Where? That's a lot of  money-loney. ...I've come to answer the want ad. What?? Eho. After you, miss. I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am. Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these... days. Um. Righty-o. What are we going to play? Oh, yes! My sister and I play that game at home all the time!  Who will go first? Well, uh... I think she's very pretty. I think she's rather insulting. Don't you wanna play anymore? Oho. Well, yes, miss. Oh, um, not so much as before.  Ow! Oh, dear. Who is that? Oh I... rather thought I was. Yes. I see.  Hoh, lovely. Joe, do you know anything about girls? But, do you anything about them? About how they work. Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith? I'm Pip, sir. Oho. But it must be Ms. Havesham! Yes sir. Good-bye, sir. None, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Mr. Pocket? Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar My, how lovely. Oh it's... quite alright.  Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havesham's house! Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havesham is very generous indeed. Well, what do you mean? Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table? Hoh, dear, I'm terribly sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Oh. Excuse me. At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house. Terribly sorry, Pocket, Good evening, Ms. Havesham. Thanks to you. Oh, my! She is even prettier than before. I don't know. I mean, I think about her every day. Righto. Yes, but... where will I find her? Thank you, Ms. Havesham! For everything! I'm the happiest boy in the land! Hello, Estella. Yes. I've become a gentleman. May I? Well, I was sent to be schooled in London. Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all. It is wonderful to see you again, Estella. Because I believe I'm in love with you. I think you do. I see past that, Estella. I see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind. Who...? Who is that? I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow? Boyfriend?? I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe! Ms. Havesham! You have to talk to Estella! She's going out with a- Ms. Havesham! But um... But I don't understand.  You sent me away to become a gentleman so that I could be with Estalla. ...Well, I suppose that if you set out to break my heart, you did a very good job of it. Because it certainly does hurt. It's... a-as if... sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss  squeezing it very tightly. But why do you make your daughter hurt people? Joe? Ms Havesham! She has all the men who have had their hearts broken by Estella trapped in her house!  Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman? Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago. You? But why? Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was Ms. Havesham. She totally let me believe it. Well, I've certainly learned a lot. That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners. It means being a gentle man. Gentle to everyone. And now I suppose there's only one thing left to do. If Ms. Havesham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE! Not so fast, you ugly ancient bitch. You won't get away with this! Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying! Come, Estella! You can't want to be part of this. Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful girl, with a kind heart. But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all!  Look at this adorable little bunny. You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck.  ...Oh. But look at this bunny.  There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies.  ...Right. Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies. So you do have too big a heart to- Ten baby bunnies! Twenty-six baby bunnies What? There! You see?! You do have a heart! No no, I'm sure of it. You have a heart! You've bought your own life! Come with me now! You're released from her now, Estella! Now we can begin our life together! They're not going to pick me. I just know they're not. Really? I don't believe it. What? Eho! Yes. Can I have some tea, please? Oh, very well. Just some crumpets, then."

"WENDY","Hi guys. Here Stan, this is for you. Ew! Hi Stan. Ew! But why Stan? Eww! Huh? What happened to your little brother? Well, why don't you go get the fat kid? Well if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the visitors are using him as part of their plan. You should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back. C'mon Stan! Ewwww! Hey, he's like rudolph! Whatever, dude. Cool! Ew! Hey look! A french fry! And what is that? Hey, what's that? WOW! I knew I would win! (Shocked) WHAT?! He doesn't even KNOW what he wrote about! MY paper was on the suffering of bottle-nosed dolphins. What?! Hitler was famous too. Mrs. Mayor? You might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated. Hi guys. I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this! (in a whisper) Hello? (Reading) My Essay - By Eric Cartman... When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone, in the woods on the shore of... (Softly) Oh my God! You guys! We have to stop him!! Mr. Garrison! He's going to try to KILL Kathie Lee Gifford! He's got a gun! It just so happens that I HAVE your paper and I KNOW why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go! Stan, I can't do it alone. Please? I know that, Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer. You see, I've learned something today. You can't win all the time. And if you don't win... You certainly can't hold it against the person who DID, because... That's the only way you ever really lose. Hi Stan. Yeah. I know, but then... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look. I thought you would reach the same conclusion, so I came as Chewbacca. Ew! Relax Stan, You'll feel better once we're out trick or treating. Hi guys. Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Narobi. Let's go trick or treats! Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad. But Stan. AAAGGHHH!!!! (groggy) Oh. What happened... Stan? I'm sorry I dissed you at school like that, Stan. I guess I just wasn't very considerate of your feelings. Maybe we could... Actually kiss tonight Stan... Eww! Gross Stan, Sick!! Barf is gross. Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate? This is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat. Many would rather die than go to those places! Oooh!! Oooh!! UGGHHH!!! AAGHAGAH!!! Okay. You guys! Look! It's snowing! Try to catch snowflakes on your tongue, it's fun! Yeah. I believe in Mr. Hankey! (Sweet) I know, but we could make a little boat out of cardboard, and pretend it's a cruise! And then we could dress up in little costumes and pretend like we're getting married. Stan? Stan? Stan, Didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one? Well it is! Well did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it? Stan, we're still valentines, right? Ms. Ellen, can I talk to you? I couldn't help but notice you taking a liking to my boyfriend Stan. Can I tell you something, Ms. Ellen? Don't. Fuck. With. Me. You heard me, stay away from my man, bitch, or I'll whup you're sorry Ho ass back to last year. Bye, Ms. Ellen! When someone gets as old as you, do they have to wear Depends under garments? Hi, Stan. (YELLING) HI, STAN!! I was just in the bathroom, and Ms. Ellen was in there taking the biggest dump I've ever seen. Yes she was! Well, she did, and she has horrible, horrible gas, too. She says she can't control it. It smelled like a dead calf rotting in the hot sun. (Like a freak) NO I'M NOT ACTING LIKE A FREAK! Thanks for coming over, Bebe. That mean ol' substitute isn't going to stop until she takes everything from me, Bebe. Yeah. What I'd really like to do is load her into a rocket and have her shot into the center of the sun. But instead, I'll just get Stan to notice ME again. Bebe, I need a MAKEOVER! (Bitchy and cool) Hi guys, What's up? Oh, hi Stan. I think it worked, Bebe! DIE!!!! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray for Mr. Garrison! (Singing) He's back! He's back! Mr. Garrison is back! So long, SUBSTITUTE! Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out now! WHAT?! You... You can't! (Screaming at the top of her lungs) NOOOOOOOOOO!!!! NOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! NOOOOOOOO!!!! NOOOO!!!!!! AAAAAGGHHGHGHGH!!!!!!! AAGAHGAH!!! AGHAGAHGAH!!!! It's over... I give up. Ms. Ellen, can I talk to you? No. I just have to apologize for the way I've been acting. No, it's not. Since you're here to stay, I just hope we can be friends. And I want to apologize to everybody. The way I acted was wrong, and I've learned from it. I just wish Stan and Ms. Ellen would have all the happiness in the world. OH, COOL!!! Wow! What incredible irony! Yeah, you just never know. Happy Valentines Day, Stan. EW!!! No, it's okay Stan! Everything's going to be okay! Thanks, Mrs. Kimble, thanks for helping me get Mr. Garrison to come back as a teacher. Oh, hi, Kyle. Uh-huh, excuse me. Ga pharat ket latn blak. Latn korat de pharat ket latn blak. Kraken blak la blaken lak Wait, wait!! Shh!! It's time to whip out the eclipse shoe boxes! Hey, he's like Rudolph. Mmmm. But Mr. Garrison! Mmmm. Wow! Cool! No they're not! Independent films are produced outside the Hollywood system. They're movies about all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. Once again, you have no idea what you're talking about, fatass! Hrmph! Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me? Stan, film festival movies usually don't have previews before them. Sshh! Come on, Stan, we're gonna be late for the screening! Hi, Stan. Ready to go see another movie? Eeewww! Stan, I'm sorry I dragged you to all those independent films. Hi, Stan. Kyle, doesn't Bebe look pretty today? She does. She looks very pretty. Stan, can I talk to you for a second? Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we fixed Kyle up with Bebe? If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then we can invite them over to your clubhouse for dinner and play parlor games and have meaningful conversations and sip cognac by the fireplace. Yeah, Stan. You don't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses. Stan, you have to build a clubhouse! Then all four of us can sit in it and play Truth or Dare! I think it did, Bebe. If all goes as planned, Kyle will be your new boyfriend. Is the clubhouse ready? Hi, guys. How's the clubhouse coming? Well, hurry! We wanna play Truth or Dare! Hi, guys. I will. Kyle? Truth, or Dare? How about we give him Bebe? Okay. Kiss Bebe on the lips! What's the matter, Kyle? Your turn, Bebe. Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow. I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here. What's happening? Oh cool! Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it! Yeah. Christ, I could have been home by now! Yeah! Dare ga pu shita no. 1776. It's not that funny, you guys. Jesus. We'll march with you, Chef. How could any of you think that flag should stay the way it is?! Stan?! How could you be so insensitive?! Nooo! Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w- Nice of you to show up! We were just discussing how we should state our case. What?? Cartman, we can't just attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. We need to present our side of the debate. The South Park flag! D'aaaaahhh! This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they- If we could show a parallel between the South Carolina case- Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any! That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist! I can't believe it. All the pressure's on us. I mean, this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote. Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument. Huh? Hey, that's a pretty good point, Cartman. Not bad at all. I may make that our first argument. Double-stuffed cookies are my favorite. Hey, that's what I always do, too! Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have anything in common with you, Cartman. Aha ha. Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say that first we talk about the history of the flag.  We can show that the- No.  You go ahead. Cartman! Say it'll be like this forever. Oh, Cartman! AAAAAAaaaah!  Brrrrr. What's wrong with me?  Ahhh. It's okay. Get a grip, girl. Aaaah! Oh God, please don't let this be happening. Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have something to tell you. Bebe, I'm attracted to Cartman. I know. Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job- You mean, I should kiss him? Oh God. The-  the- uh,  aheh ahum,  the... the- uh,  Ahhhhh,  The first argument we- ah...  Let me start over.  The uh-  oh God. Could you all excuse me for a moment? Yes. Now, the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history. As times change we hope to grow, and as we grow our rules must change. It is a natural part of evolution. Thank you. Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with. I can't believe how right Bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody.  WENDY Yeah! What's that? You guys don't actually think this is going to work, do you? Doctor, doctor! Will our daughter be okay? Oh no! NO! My poor little Helen. She can't see or hear us, John. I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey. Do you think we could make up a good Thanksgiving play in four days? Oh, no! John, come quick! Our little baby's very sick She can't see hear, John. Watch. Helen! ...Helen! Oh no! Oh no!!! There is nothing we can do for our poor daughter. We cannot reach her. Aha, Ms. Choksondik, aren't manatees endangered? Oh, we wanna hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited. I didn't mean that- Stay away from me, Stan! Are you wearing a condom? Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease? You guys have to wear condoms. Now, please, just, just go away. We don't want your AIDS. Stay away from us, bastards! We don't wanna get pregnant! Yeah. Thank God. We're at war with terrorists, fatass, not with Afghanistan, and the only reason that you care is that you don't wanna give up the dollar! The Afghan kids are caught in the middle, too! I can't believe it's been two weeks since I've seen you guys. What have you been doing? Hey Bebe. Oh my God, Bebe. You got boobs. ...And I was like, ""I'm not buying those shoes for twenty dollars."" Stan, you've never asked me to throw rocks at cars with you guys. Oh, for Christ's sake! ""The new Cold War"" But, then the mall closes at four or five o'clock, so who knows w- No! Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's so cool all of a sudden. I heard that her asshole is this big around. Oh, hey Bebe.  Slut.  Slut. Oh, no, that's okay Bebe. You might trip and then we'd be sucked into your huge gaping vagina like ants into a vacuum cleaner.  Slut.  Slut. Slut. What are you doing?! I'm class president! The vote was last fall! She's not smarter and cooler than everyone, you guys are just drawn to something else! Ugh! God, you guys are sooo stupid! Yes! I want to get breast implants! That's what I said. I have three thousand dollars, cash. Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I've been wanting to break up for a while. but it's, it's nothing against him. Yeah? Well tell Stan to stop!! But aren't Indians and Redskins just as offensive? We're gonna miss what? Who's Paris Hilton? I don't get it. What does she do? ...but what does she do? What does she do?! You guys, don't buy this stuff. Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton? But the idea that we'll be whorish for money is belittling to our gender! Hey Jessie , hey Kal. Do you guys mind if I hang out with you? The other girls are acting really strange. Oh, well, you wanna maybe go to the art museum? What?? Mom, Dad, I'm growing concerned about the role models young women have in today's society. It seems that lewdness and shallowness are being exalted, while intellectualism is looked down upon. I think young women are being marketed to by corrupt, moral-less corporations. Dad, there's a new store at the mall called ""Stupid Spoiled Whore"" and I'm gonna go there and buy a thong! Dad!! Hey Bebe. I heard you were having a party tonight. I'm a stupid spoiled whore. That's okay. Yes. Nno, I need help becoming a dirty whore like you Mr. Slave, you're the most perverted, lewd, depraved slut I know. Can you teach me your secret fast? Because all the other girls are. They're having a huge sex party right now and I'm not invited. What is Mr. Slave doing? He he's just sitting there. That's okay, you guys."

If I can show just how much I've turned South Park around... I could become a Senator!! That's right... He's a black guy isn't he? (triumphantly) YES!! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play! Kathie Lee loves children! Children, as you all know, Ms. Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay. Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you Luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park. Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play. Who cares? Now kids, what say we give it our South Park best?! And who's our little prize winner again? How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the T.V. cameras don't we? C'mon people! We've got to turn this place around!! Hang up the lights! String up the banners! Castrate the cows!! Well, Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going? Oh, please do! I'm dying to see it! Oh, don't they look adorable? Oh my God!! Mr. Garrison! We cannot have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford! MR. GARRISON! THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE! DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK THAT Kathie LEE GIFFORD WOULD ENJOY THIS?!?! Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play. Where is she? HERE SHE COMES!!! It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park! And now, our very own South Park Elementary Chef will sing a special song in honor of Mrs. Lee-Gifford! What??? What??? (Grabbing the mic) Uh, thank you Chef for that heartwarming song- (in total shock) THANK YOU, CHEF!! And now, Here to present the award for the Environmental essay to our own Eric Kaufman- -Is your favorite celebrity and mine; Kathie LEE GIFFORD!!! I just had a brown baby boy! This certainly has been an enlightening evening. And as Mayor, I accept your petition and will abolish all separation laws. And I want to assure the nation that is watching that South Park is not a town of prejudice or bigotry. God no. This guys' insane. Alright, Jared, you sick pervert! Do you have anything to say before you die?? You mean, Jared's aides are like my aides? He's right. It happened! People, people, calm down. Yes, but standing out here yelling ""Rabble rabble rabble"" isn't going to help anything. People, what do you think we need to do? ...And so, we want you to design and build a great wall, all around the city. Mr. Lu Kim, tear down this wall! These boys symbolize how we all feel about loss. Who are we to tell them it's impossible? Good evening, everyone. In a moment we'll be lighting the South Park Christmas Tree to kick off the holidays! But now, before we light the tree, I think we should all reflect for a moment on those who are less fortunate than us.  Right now in Iraq there are children who fear us and what we might do to their country. The threat of war touches us all, but over in Iraq, their is no Christmas. They have nothing. Ahalright, here to light the Christmas Tree is a very special young man who shows us all the true meaning of Christmas. Jimmy. Well, we'd love a Christmas song, wouldn't we, folks? That's it? That's it! The song's over! We can light the tree! Go on, Jimmy! There's only five more seconds until Christmas! And so without further ado, here's the most courageous, most amazing man on the planet, Christopher Reeve. Okay, people. What are we rabbling about now? Quiet people! The town square is public space. That means if neither group will nicely and maturely move the day of its rally, I'll just have have to give the town square to both groups. People, I told you, you have to share the stage. And that's really all I can tell you. The town of South Park is going to be leveled, in order to make way for a twelve-lane superhighway. The Native Americans have purchased the land from under us. Tomorrow, they're buying the last of what they need to have complete ownership. The Native Americans bought the bank. Now, look, it isn't all horrible. The Native Americans are offering you retail values on your homes. Three hundred thousand dollars. As we celebrate this glorious time, we can't forget those families who are suffering. As many of you know, the Broflovski family has recently had their child torn away from them. As a community, we must do all we can to ease their pain. Are there any suggestions how we might help? Mr. Garrison, every Christmas you suggest we get rid of all the Mexicans, and every Christmas we tell you ""NO!"" Then it's settled: This year we'll give all our Christmas money to the Broflovskis, in hopes that they may someday have their child returned to them. All right, people, we are all extremely upset over what's happened.  But let's try to speak one at a time. As it was in the times of our forefathers, so it is now. Stan Marsh, for not following our most sacred of rites, you are hereby banished from South Park for all eternity. Or until you decide that voting is important. Good-bye, Stan. May the gods treat you more kindly than we did. All right, people, we can move onto issue number 14B. Kid, we're have a city council meeting. Kid, what the hell are you talking about? Johnson, get him out of here. I know. I signed the permit. I signed a permit allowing them to have their concert here. Their little ""festival"" should pump some money into our economy. They don't have to know. I can sign whatever permit I want! All right, let's go. What have I done? All right, people, let's save it! They still have a long way to go! What's happened? That's it. We're going to Plan B. Nuke the crowd!"

Using the wood that Krishna cut down as a beaver, Jesus uses his master carpentry skills to make a giant mold. Meanwhile, in the ocean depths, Seaman seeks out water to mix with the concrete.

They were considered the best comedy act in all of Canada.  But a fast-paced rocket ride to success would bring themto the depths of despair.  This is Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow. Terrance was born Terrance Herny Stoot, in the small Canadian village of Toronto. At a very early age his parents noticed an uncanny musical ability and decided to enroll him in the Canadian School for gifted babies.  It was here that he partnered up with Phillip Niles Argyle , a brash young baby from Montreal. Together, they performed musical acts that stunned Canadians everywhere. At the tender age of six, Terrance and Phillip were off to the United States to perform on the Ed Sullivan show . where American audiences would be exposed to Canadians for the first time. The Canadian act confused American audiences. But then something happened that would change Terrance and Phillip's act forever. It was the birth of Canadian comedy. Terrance and Phillip spent the next several years perfecting their art, and meetng some of America's most infuential people. But it was in 1974, on the Sonny & Cher Show, that Terrance and Phillip finally started to mix their Canadian humor with deep political insight. With this bold mix of humor and political insight, the world couldn't get enough of Terrance and Phillip.  But their fame would come at a price, when Behind the Blow continues. As they entered their late teens, Terrance and Phillip were already starting to taste the sweet milk of success.  But the price of fame was looming, as Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow continues. The '70s and '80s were a good time for young Terrance and Phillip.  Their act on the Donny and Marie Show earned them a Nobel Peace Prize. They were oin the cover of every magazine.  And then in 1998, even a saturday morning cartoon was made, based on Terrance and Phillip.  Terrance and Phillip themselves supplied the voices. The cartoon was such a huge success that it started to breed confusion over whether Terrance and Phillip were animated characters or real people. And so, in 1998,  the comedy team started work on what they thought would be their greatest achievement: A made-for-TV movie written by and starring Terrance and Phillip, called ""Not Without My Anus.""  It was their biggest project to date. But it had the misfortune of being scheduled on a night when a different and more pupolar show, the John Schneider Variety Hour , was supposed to air. When fans tuned in to see John Schneider and instead were treated to the Canadian made-for-TV movie , they were enraged, bewildered, and scared.  The fans revolted and burned down the network, killing six television producers and wounding twelve others.  The hatred of Terrance and Phillip had begun. Terrance fell into a deep depression and started abusing wod pulp  Phillip beat up an angry six-year-old fan and was sued for six million dollars. It was the first time the duo tasted failure , and it nearly killed them both. After years of depression and suicide attempts, Terrance and Phillip finally decided to get together  for one last film:  the 1999 hit, Asses of Fire. It was one of the highest-grossing films of the summer.  And though the film also started the Canadian-American War of 1999 , in which eight million people lost their lives, the film was conisdered a great success.  After almost being executed by the Aemrican government , Terrance and Phillip were eventually returned to Canada , where they were touted as heroes.  They have been to hell and back, through the very best and the very worst of times, together, but they had seen it through.  And so ends Terrance and Phillip, Behind the Blow. Snacky S'mores presents: The Miracle of Child Birth.  The time is drawing close for delivery. Here we can see the water breaking. Later, the contractions are happening closer together. Mom sure is in a lot of pain. Now we can see the crown of the baby's head, stretching the vaginal walls in ways never before thought possible by Mom. Finally, the miracle happens, and the baby is born.  but Mom's not done yet. She still got some afterbirth to push out of her. That's right. The story begins in ages past, in the deep regions of Middle Earth, where Scorn first thrived in the kingdom of Gelgelar. Seven rings were cast and given to the races of men. Seven, to the races of elves, five to the gloondock villagers of Gelgendor. So it was that the heroes traveled many miles to return the Lord of the Rings to the video store. The quest continued to return the Lord of the Rings to the video store. Looks like them boys are gettin' a little fresh air. Well, it looks like the boys are in more trouble than a June bug in molasses. And it's pretty thick molasses, too. ...The little woodland critters were also preparing for their Christmas day. The little critters worked hard as they happily sang And so, using some paper and working with glee, The little critters cheered and Beavery said with a smile The boy in the red poofball hat smiled and said His friends were all there! What a wonderful surprise! ""Of course I'll build you a little manger!"" the little boy cried, And out in the woods the boy steamed right ahead, High up in the forest on a dark, craggy peak, Said the little boy in the red poofball hat. In a flash it was over! A victorious blow! The tiny cubs all gathered together and cried, In the gentle forest clearing on Christmas Eve morn, Now that he'd killed the noble lion queen, ""I know!"" he said with a new happy grin, He ran out the living room, turned out the light, ... and went back to the forest to set everything right! He knew that only by going to the forest could he- The boy shook with anger! He broke a sweat and fell ill ""Where can they learn that?"" the boy said with a frown. So he picked up the cubs and down the mountain he stormed. Yes he did. Yes he did. Yes he  did! Said the boy in the red poofball hat! ""We've made it already, little cubs! Fancy that!"" The abortion doctor inquired. And so the little boy and the cubs gathered around the chair base, Twas the night before Christmas, and above the woods, way up high, He arrived at the critter forest ready to fight, The Antichrist had been born, sealing the world's fate. When up in the sky the sound of sleigh bells were heard And a jolly red sleigh flew down to the earth like a bird! The little boy fretted. He almost started to bawl The little boy quickly begun, And in the twinkling starlight, each little cub did their portion. And back home, there were presents, and lots of food to get fat. And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Kyle, who died of AIDS two weeks later."

It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago. I guess they don't wanna fight. Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last? Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight. Mr. Adler. Mr. Adler! Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander What's that? What? She die or something? Oh boy! Here we go! All that build-up for nothing. Programs, get your programs here. Programs. Hababah. Wow! I wanna sue somebody! Kyle's dad got me 1.4 million, and he can do it for you, too. Just look at all these beautiful girls! Um. We've got to get that picture to your mom so that she will come home and save us. Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are. Huh? I'm not fat. Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned. So I don't get to be on the team now? Right here. For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit! Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back!  Thank you so much. Thank you. Right. Yeah. If we died right now, we'd have unclean souls and we'd burn in hell. ...We've gotta get to that church before we die. Like what? Hey, Timmy might need some help pulling his pants down. Oh, now what? Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy? Tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression Oppression. Our play begins in a simpler time.  Alabama, in the late 1800's Oh.  Cool! He's here! Yeah, and it's from Broadway. We're never gonna outdo them now! I've got three. Who's Scott Tenorman? Ah, excuse me? My daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming. Thank you. Oh. Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving. There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out. You mean they both have butts instead of heads? Yeah, we gotta remember to kick his ass tomorrow. Wwooww. ...What if we don't want to be your friend? This whole thing is stupid! You don't pick people you wanna be with by making it into a game! Hey Token. You know, I never noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool. That is an awesome answer! Wow, hellafun. That's awesome. It's weird how we never noticed before. You try it, Bebe. Yeah.  Here, it's like if you put your thumb on this side- Yeah, just let me show her real quick how to put the thumb and- Hoh hoh hoh! My paper is called, ""Why Bebe is the coolest person, ever."" Hoh! ""My friend Bebe is really smart. She tells funny jokes and knows a lot about stuff. She's good at almost everything she tries. She's awesome. The end."" Chase his tail? That must be so funny? Have any of you dumb girls seen Bebe anywhere? We're tryin' to get Bebe to run for class president. What? Yeah! Yeah! Bebe! Where Bebe?! Bebe! Bebe! Yeah. Screw boobs! They're stupid! Let's never let boobs come between us again! What do you guys want? Oh. Okay, hang on a second.  What troubles you? So? I have three copies. And the DVD with twelve hours of extra footage. Very well, I shall call the council together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering behind Talangar the Black's house. And don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll get in trouble. Faragon, asshole! And so that is the situation. The video may or may not have evil power. Kyle, would you bring it up here, please? Look, until we see this tape's power for ourselves, we cannot risk giving it to anybody. That is true. Only a Paladin with a high constitution should watch the tape. Therefore, I think it is a job for you, Talangar the Black. What vice did you see on the videotape, Talangar? Is it the work of Sauron's magic? One thing for sure, this tape cannot be trusted with anybody. This must be returned to the video store from whence it came. There's no alternative. We have to return the tape before it causes more damage! Ha! We cannot trust something of that much power to a dwarf! Especially a kindergartner dwarf. It is too far and too dangerous to go alone. Take with you the wizard , the dwarf , the warrior , the cleric , and the Jew . Very well. You shall be the Fellowship of the Lord of the Rings. Good luck. I have to go home now before I get in trouble. I'm not gonna touch it. You throw it away. Nobody wants to touch it. And the commercial where the two kids have pot and the one kids shoots the other. Harmless? Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down. Oh my God, where is my homework?! I am fr-eaking a-out! Yeah, go kick his ass. Let me see. From the nice guy at the county fair. Then fight us! Butters! Butters! But we like being the Cows! What do you guys want? I haven't decided yet. Sure. I'm still not totally sure. Animals Close-Up With A Wide Angle Lens. Put it, put it up on the, monitors! Aaaaah, owieeee, owieeee. What happens to the lion cubs? Yeah yeah, come on! Did it hurt? Like that motorcycle kid in Bad News Bears. I never realized ignoring him was an option. Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring you now."
"BEBE","(Reciting loudly) This is the story of South Park... It begins over a hundred years ago when the noble and hardy Ute Indians lived on the land. Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers... The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands... I wanna pot-bellied elephant! Our slide! Oh yeah, I bet I can get spit in his hair! I want a Starvin' Marvin! You guys are so immature! Act like eight year olds! That's okay, Wendy. I brought my make-up kit like you asked me. What are we doing, anyway? Really? Oh, cool! Yeah! I heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch. Down! Did it work? I hope so Wendy. He's got such a hot ass. Pass this up. Kyle, could you turn around for a second? Thank you! Come on, Wendy. Don't you guys still wanna play ""Truth or Dare""? Then come on! Who wants to go first? Okay. Okay. Wow, look at that ass! Shake it, baby! Okay, Stan. Truth or Dare?  Stan, Truth or Dare? Kyle, can I talk to you? Kyle, this is very difficult for me. I think we need time apart. I'm just feeling really trapped. I can't go on with this codependency. No, no. Don't speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way. Please. Just remember the good times we have. I'll never forget you. Never. Okay, Clyde, we can go now. Okay. It's my turn. Stan? Truth or Dare? Take this stick and jam it up your peehole. Bye, Kenny. See you tomorrow. What if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer, but is still getting his degree? I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life. Come on! It's time for the fight! Me, too. I wanna get a lawyer. After a boy in my class tried to put his tongue in my nouth, I knew I needed legal help. Kyle's dad helped me get a $1.6 million settlement, and this bright new shiny bicycle. Thank you, Kyle's dad! Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so! Sure, what? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Why would you tell me this? Why would you tell anyone this? Alright, look. When two people work closely for a long time, sometimes they feel what's called, ""sexual tension."" Sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with. Kiss him and get it out of your system. Are we gonna get paid now, or after? We wouldn't give a rat's ass if Leonardo Di Caprio came walking past us. Oh. Okay. Okay, so where's our money? Let's go ice-skating. Hello. My name is Anne Sullivan, and I believe I can teach this child to communicate. Water, Helen! Waaa-terr! Her feathers are beautiful. Water, Helen. It has a name. Oh, why can't you understand? Water, Helen, Water. Helen, Helen. Water, Helen. Yes, that's it.  That's it, Helen. Water! WA-TER! She did it! I've got three. Yeah, we think it's gonna be fun! Do any of you have your condoms on? Yuh huh! If you don't wear a condom, you're gonna get AIDS. Yeah! Just take your diseases and go away forever! We'll never walk away. Never! Hey guys. You guys uh,  notice anything different? Yeah, they started coming in last week. At first I thought they were just mosquito bites, but, then they didn't go away. :	 Oh, uh, forty-eight? Yeah? Really?  I've never done that before. Why sure, that sounds hellafun. Cool. Okay. Uh. Listen guys, un, It's five-thirty. I'm supposed to get home, so... I'll see you later. Hey everybody. ""My cat Thumper."" ""Thumper is gray with a white spot. Sometimes he likes to chase his tail. ""Thumper is twelve years old. That's pretty old for a cat. The end."" Hey guys. ...You guys still wanna go ice-skating after school? Oh Mom, it's just... My girlfriends at school said some really mean things to me today.  They called me a slut, with a huge gaping vagina. But am I slutty just because I'm beginning to be friends with guys? I mean, they just like me because they think I'm smart and cool. I remember when I was a little girl the boys didn't think I was very smart at all. But then one day, they all started thinking I was really smart. I guess big smarts just run in our family. Well if the girls don't wanna be my friend, that's fine!  Guys are way cooler, anyways. Thanks for inviting me to ride the bus to school with you guys. Precious? Uh huh. It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again. It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again. Put the lotion in the basket! Don't you hurt my fucking dog! You guys, calm down! This is insane! Stop it you guys, please! Oh boy, I never meant to cause all this trouble. I know. They've been there all day. Mom, why is everyone acting so different around me? But, I, I don't know if I want to. Sometimes I think I'm not as smart and cool as they say, that everyone just tells me I am because of my hooters. Mom?  What's six times eight? Having boobs sucks. I wanna have breast-reduction surgery. Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars in nickels and a gold bracelet. Why not? Britney Spears got fake ones when she was a teenager. Why can't I have mine taken off? I think it's insane to want them bigger. Ever since I got these stupid things everyone treats me differently. I feel like I might be treated differently the rest of my life. Please, you have to help me. I think that if my breasts keep growing this way, boys will give me whatever I want. No it's not, because if I grow up getting everything I want, having things made easy for me because I have hot knockers, then I'm gonna grow up to be a lame person. If I'm handed everything in life, then my chances of becoming a lawyer or a marine biologist are zero. Damnit! Oh, fuck off! MOM!! MOM!! My breasts! No, they're conspiring! Mom, they were talking! They wanna destroy the town! That does it! I'm NOT letting these things run my life! Hey guys. Oh cool! It worked! Yes! Right. My boobs just clouded your judgment. Wow, Ben Affleck. Wendy breaks up. Wendy breaks up with you. She just doesn't wanna be with you anymore. She said she still wants to be friends. Fuck you, fatass! You guys are assholes! God, you're so stupid! Stan, why don't you show her you love her? If you really want Wendy back, try doing the most romantic thing you can think of. If you really want a shot at getting her back, stand outside her window, hold a boombox over your head, and play Peter Gabriel. I think us Cows have the best school spirit. Huh, Mandy? Let's bring out our mascot and get this pep rally going! Is somebody in there? I'll tell on you! Come on, Wendy, we'er gonna miss it. Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall. Wow, that's really her! Paris! Over here! Wow, look at all this great stuff. Stupid Spoiled Whore clothes, Stupid Spoiled Whore dolls, Wendy, get a clue. The only thing more important than being rich is being famous! Thanks, Annie! You wouldn't be interested, Wendy. My parents are out of town, so it's a Stupid Spoiled Whore party. You're not even spoiled, because your parents give money to charity! Sorry Wendy. You're just not a whore. Get lost! Party at my house tonight, Clyde. You're invited. Party at my house tonight, Kyle. Now here's what I'm talking about. A little midngith blue! Hey Kevin, party at my house. We're being stupid spoiled whores. What did you do, Wendy?! Go rat on us because you're not invited to our Paris Hilton party?! Wow, Paris Hilton is at my party! I rule! Mr. Slave has no idea what he's in for. Wow, I guess Paris isn't such hot shit after all. Wendy, we're sorry we called you names. Like not-stupid and not-spoiled."
"TOWNSWOMAN","(gasping) He said 'to HELL with Kathie Lee Gifford'! WE LOVE YOU Kathie LEE!!"
"TOWNSPERSON","God Damn, that is a big fat ass! Howdy, Mr. Garrison, nice gun! Who cares? Hey, I'm on TV, I'm on TV!!! If we lose our money 'cause of your nephew, we're gonna hang you up to dry, Jimbo! Speech! OLIVER!! I thought you ran away all those months ago! There's too many of them. We can't stop them. We did it! Wait wait!! There's a star above the stage! That's very offensive to non- Christians! HEY! Don't push your beliefs on ME buddy!! Whoopeee! This is killer!! I got a TV. Shhhh come on. Speech! Speech!"
"JIMBO","Can I help you? Would this be for hunting, home- protection or other? Alrighty, then may I suggest the Stratford twelve millimeter. Here, try it on. That looks really nice on you. The lacquered black really matches your eyes. Okay, how about this? Here's the same gun with a wood finish. That's right, Stanley, animals are much easier to shoot in the morning! Don't worry, Ms. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe. Ho Ho, that's disgusting! That's the spirit, boys! Let's get that testosterone flowing!! Now boys, boys, I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting since this is your first time. First of all, don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third never spill your beer in the bullet chamber. You what? Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip. After all, hunting sober is like fishing sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while. Away from civilization. Well, here we are! Okay, each of you young'ins take a gun, a beer and some smokes. Hey, look out son, that's dangerous! You're gonna spill your beer! Boys! Lookie there! That there's a Rocky Mountain Black Bear. One of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful? My God it's coming right for us!!! SHHH! Not so loud!! Now that there's just a technicality. You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting. They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot something, we have to say; ""It's coming right for us!"" Oh, it's a deer. Looks like about a 46 gauge, Ned. IT'S COMIN' RIGHT FOR US!!! Did ya see that? I was imperiled by that ferocious charging buck! Let's move! MOVE!!! This one's yours, Stan! 'It's comin' right for us'! What the-- What's wrong with you?! (shocked) What the hell are you talking about, you don't want to shoot the bunny? You're babbling, you're not making any sense! You're hysterical! No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree hugger! Well Ned, looks like we'll have to use the ol' Indian fire trick. (Laughing) HA, HA! HEY, STOP, DROP AND ROLL, NED!! HA, HA!! Godammit Ned, I just got that van! How the hell are we supposed to get home? And then Ned picked up the grenade and BLOOM!! Blasted his arm clear off! We spent three hours looking for that damn arm. But it was never to be found! Some say it's still crawling around to this day! Ha, ha! Got'chya! Hey Ned, hand me that gin. You boys want to tie one on? What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you handle a little alcohol? Christ! Look at the little bastard go! Now you see that Stan? Now now that is a dirty little bastard. Hey Ned, Why don't you whip out the old cancer Kazoo, let's do a little song. What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one!! There's a fish right there!! Great instincts, boy! Who, the fat kid? Oh hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we gotta cut it short. Fire up the 12-20. Well, I think that's about the limit for our fishing permit. Yeah! I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you, Kenny. I'm making you my honorary Nephew! Well, he couldn't have gone far... Unless something drug him off... Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on... Christ Ned, what'd you have for breakfast? Wait, There's a ram! It's coming right for us! Nice shooting, Kenny! Here, you need a bigger gun! Holy crow! We could make a MINT killing this thing!! This calls for some HJ-14! Fire in the hole! Dammit, I think I missed! Come on, let's move! MOVE!! These look like his tracks! He must have gone this way! Ned! Prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it-- BIRD!! The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe. Are we sure it's Scuzzlebutt? Well I can't tell. Let's kill it. Kenny, you take the front. That's the spirit, kiddo! Let's hunt! You pansy! Give me that gun! What the Sam Hell? Yepper. But I think we've learned some important lessons Ned- I think that - The Mountain, it's BLOWN IT'S TOP!!! That lava's coming right for us! What the hell is this trench doing here? We can't get across! Jiminy Poke! It's the REAL Scuzzlebutt! Quick Ned! Shoot it!!! Well, boys... I'm sorry I got you all killed. Hey! He's saving us!! Damnit Stan, you shouldn't have done that! Stan, some things you kill and some things you don't. See? But Kenny's dead now Stan, and you're Hey, how's practice coming there, Chef? I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park alumni. That's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year? Middle Park by seventy points. Nonsense, not with MY nephew at quaterback! Right, Stanly?! Atta boy!! C'mon, Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie! I want five hundred dollars on the South Park Cows! No siree, I'm telling you I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I GUARANTEE they'll beat the spread!! Uh -- Woa... Woa... Don't get TOO carried away, now... I... (A little uneasy) Huh, huh... yea, don't, don't worry yourself. (Quietly) Not THAT sure... I think we better come up with a back up plan... Uh let's see. Hey Bookie, what's the half time show gonna be? Loving You?? THAT'S PERFECT!!! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a halftime show they'll never forget! What we want to do, Carl, is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime. Well, John Stomos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F. You know -- No damnit the AAAHHHH!! AHHHHHH! Doot'n doot'n doo doo. Ahhh You got it. Come on, Ned, and keep quiet. Hello there, Enrique. Well, Ned, we always kidnap middle park's mascot... But THIS year we're gonna booby trap it instead! And when John Stamos older brother hits that high F in 'Loving You' BOOM!! No more middle park players!! God damn I love football! Ned! Look! They've got Enrique on their sidelines! And it looks like that bomb is still attached! Hell's bells. Don't ya'll worry... You just wait 'til halftime! What the hell?! He didn't sing the high F!!! Ned... We're gonna get our asses kicked. Give 'em hell, Stanly!! (Praying) Jesus... Now I haven't asked you for much... But all we need is one little score. PLEASE? PLEASE Jesus?? What?! There you are! Stanly, you tore up my entire gun shop! You better have a GOOD explanation for this Mister! I'm gonna have a word with your father Stanley. What the hell is going on?! Come on Ned! We gotta get our asses to the bookie!! We're all with you Jesus! We put every dime we have on you beating that Dark Prince! Now that is a man who has eaten a lot of beef. Well... I think I'll uh... I think I left the oven on... I want to change my bet to Satan!! Yeah! No way! He barely touched him! Yeah. Man... That guy is a JERK!! Well Jesus, I definitely learned MY lesson. Never bet on evil, because when you do -- Ned, look! That's a rare duck billed platypus! It's comin' right for us!!! The last three are getting away. Shoot 'em Ned! And I'm sick and tired of those little flaps on coffee lids! If you don't want to spill your coffee then you shouldn't be driving with it!! Is mistletoe offensive? Oh, come on! Holy crap, Ned! That's the biggest goddamn deer I've ever SEEN!! GET AROUND SIDE HER, NED!! I CAN'T GET A SHOT IN FROM HERE!! Come on everybody, let's do the drunken barn dance!! Hey everybody! Look who's here!! The AFC champion Denver Broncos!!! Garrison?! That's impossible! He's gay! He's gay! Don't feel too bad there, kid. I never knew who my father was either... (Pause) I mean, I DID know who he was, and, well, we had great times together and huntin' and fishin', but -- well, hell, you know what I mean. No, he's gay! Agh! It's a power outage! Hey, this window is shot out, too! That means the killer was NOT somebody in this room! There's a murderer free in South Park! We have to find out who it is before they kill again! What are we going to do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose!! Mayor, shouldn't we be focusing on -- Holy smokes! That blizzard is gettin' crazy! Well, we're not going anywhere for a long time. I hope you all realize what we might be facing here... Our only option might be to EAT EACH OTHER to stay alive! That's the law of the land, Mr. Director. I know it ain't pretty, but if a few of us might die so that the rest can stay alive so be it. Well, we draw straws. CALM DOWN, SOLDIER!! WE NEED EVERY PERSON HERE TO KEEP HIS HEAD!! Alright, so far everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing... Whew! Wait a minute... Where the hell is the short one? Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws you're supposed to have one of 'em short, that's how you decide who loses! We have to have energy to make it through the night... We have to eat. There's only one answer... Eat Eric Roberts. God wants you to live, Mayor. Fight! What time is it, Barbrady? We'll give the storm another hour. After that... We might have to eat again... It is amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids nobody knows how they built those. Or who. Listen everybody, we did what we had to in there. Get outta the way, you damn hippie! What? Aw, why don't you go to a Grateful Dead concert? Tough love, Mr. Mackey. We're taking you to rehab. Excuse me, Mayor, but I just received some news that you might all be interested in.  Our South Park Cows have jsut beaten the Washington dodgeball team, and are on their way to the world championship in China. Now, idn't that great?  We have a terrific show for you today: we're gonna kill some elk, and we're gonna kill some mountain goats. Now, the new law passed by Colorado legislature, which Ned and I call 'Pussy Law #4', states that we can no longer kill animals in defense. -no longer works. So now, we only kill naimals to, quote, thin out their numbers. If we don't hunt, then these animals will grow too big in number and they won't have enough food. So you see, we have to kill animals, or else they'll DIE.  Uuh. So, roll the tape.  Here we are at Shafer's Crossing lookin' for some animals. Looky, Ned, there are some deer!  Quick, Ned. Thin out their numbers! Good work, Ned. Now, they won't starve. That sure was a great hunting trip. We saved those deer from extinction. Comin' up next, we're gonna drop some napalm on an unsuspecting family of beavers. And also, try to thin out the numbers of some endangered species. And now, time for Well, be sure to join us next time. Until then Oh, looky who's here. My little nephew, Stanley.  So, you're interested in your Uncle Jimbo's big TV show, huh? Oh. Yeah, we sure were. Well, sure Vietnam was fun. But not like goin-to-the-circus fun, or fly-fishin-in-Montana fun. No, Vietnam was more like shovin' shards of broken glass up your ass and then sittin' in a tub of Tabasco sauce fun. Yeppur, that's where me and Ned met. I remember I had just gotten off the Ferris wheel. Oh, boy, what a gorgeous day! Soon it was all on just me and Ned to win the war for America. Pass me some more cocoa, will you, Ned? Why the hell not? We're at war.  Hey, you know those things are bad for your throat. I see 'em! Drop the bomb! Oh, no! Then we only have one option. We have to take 'em out, Ned! At all costs! Die, you red Commie bastarts!! Eeeeehhhh-oh no! Out of ammo!  We did it, Ned! We killed the entire Viet Cong army! Let's get back to base camp. We can ride the log ride before it closes! And that's the way it happened, boys. Wow! Holy Smokes! We could get an Emmy! Welcome, hunters. Boy, have we got a show for you today! We have just received a tape from another viewer who filmed the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka right here in South Park. Yes, now we're about to roll the film, but remember: if you look the Mexican staring frog in the eyes, you could go catatonic. We don't know if this applies to pictures of the frog or not, but who wants to take chances? So when we roll this film, be sure to look away. Okay, roll the film, Tom.  Is it over? Well, it appears that now a lot of you uh ""skeptics"" thought that the film we showed of the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka was a fake. That you say it didn't harm anybody. Well, it just so happens that we just received another film from another anonymous viewer.  Roll it.  There you go. Proof that not only is this frog real, but it is doing harm to the people of South Park as we speak. Well, that does it! All this week, Ned and I will be risking life and limb as we on location to hunt the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka! Join us, won'tcha? Anonymous tip? Hey Ned. Remember that time when we got the anonymous tip back in 'Nam? Yeup. That was was hell on everybody. Wow, do we got more money? Let's hunt! Hit the deck!! It's him! The Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka! He's right over there on that rock! Dumbass, you've got to keep your eyes away from him.  Stay down. Ned, you take flight position; I'll try to keep it turned away from you. Hello, fellow hunters. Have we got a show for you today.  The Mexican staring frog is sunning itself on a rock directly behind us.  We've got to take the frog by surprise. I'm gonna create a diversion using this incendiary device  while Ned will ambush him from the rear. Now, Ned. He's not lookin'.  Quick, Ned, hit him with the shotgun! Now, Ned!  Ned? Ne-ed.  Oh, no!  Come on, Ned buddy, snap out of it!  Come back to me, buddy. Hold on to your butts.  Take that, you demon frog!!  Ned, Ned. Can you hear me?  Somebody, call an ambulance. This man is catatonic! ü¾ ¼but Pony Boy was beat up pretty bad. He kept saying, 'stay gold.'  Aw, Ned. If you can hear me, yyou've got to snap out of it, 'cause if you don't, uh- I'll never forgive myself.  Aw, Stanley, he's gone! My only friend in the world is gone! Aaww! What the hell are you doin'? I almost looked right at it! What? You sent in those videos?! My best friend is a vegetable, and I'm gonna be the laughing stock of South Park! You boys don't understand. Ned was so freaked out by the idea of the Mexican staring frog that he must've sent himself into a deep coma. Uuuuuuuuh. Thanks? That's right, Jesus. No respect for their elders. As some of you may know, I host a local show on hunting.  Thanks. We've been hunting the Mexican staring frog for a week based on some video footage we received from a viewer. Well, it turns out that these kids faked the footage! Like what? Satan. Got it. Give you a taste of your own medicine, you little fibber! Roger. I'll tell you why. Because he's on drugs and worships the Devil. Why, you little piece of crap! Hey! Bring it on, you bitch! Hey, now. Everything I told you boys about the war actually happened. I uhü¾ ¼ Well, okay, I might have embellished the truth a little, but that's different. Well, sure. I mean, ehü¾ ¼  Well, no uh, I guess not. It's true. She did. Hu-I'm such a tool. I'm sorry, Stan uh, I was just trying to tell a good story. I never meant for you boys to get in trouble. Aw, he'll be fine. I'll just take him home and show him some good hard-core porn-he'll snap right out of it. Won't you, Ned? Yeah. TV's and beer. The lava's comin' right for us! Jimminy Hope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt! Quick Ned, shoot it! Hey there, boys! How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer. What?! Oh my God!  Well, don't worry boys. Uncle Jimbo is on the case.  Buckle your seat belt, Ned. Mejico, my amigo. Buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer now, does it? Hell, everything's legal in Mejico. It's the American way. Buenos dias, mi amigo.  Yo soy un Americano spectacularrrr. Yo necesito el fireworko spectacularrrr! Would you look at that, Ned! That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a firehole right through the ozone! Ned. It's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July. We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning. Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to the Amrican border. They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. Just let me do the talking.  Ha ha ha ha, I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it? Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland. Fire away, we have nothing to hide. No, sir. Yeah.  I mean, no! No. Damn! Damn, I always get that question wrong. Well Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again. Dammit. Those poor kids must've been so disappointed to have nothin' but them stupid wussy snakes to light. Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's try again. No. Yes?  Dammit, I got it wrong again! What's the answer again?  Holy smokes! What the hell is that?! Quick, Ned. This is our chance! The Hummer is outside! Buenos gracias, boys. Aw, hell, why the long faces? Weelll, I don't think those are problems that some Tijuana bottle rockets can't solve. Careful with those, now. Those are dangerous. Point them away from your eyes now. Aw, look at 'em, Ned. Look how much happiness a little firepower can bring to a child. Hwell, how do you like that? The bottle rockets saved the Fourth of July! Well, it's snowing black ash, but what the hell. This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial!  Which will live forever in South Park from this day forth. Release the curtain! Okay, everybody! It's time for the Running of the Cows! Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows.  With that said, let's rock and roll!  Everybody ready to run? Release the cows!  They're loose! Yeehaw! All right, damn it! We're not going to stand for this! Now, whoever stole our golden cow memorial, we're gonna find you and kill you!  Aall right, uhow about this? Whoever took the sacred cow, just please return 'im, and there'll be no quesitons asked.  Wait a minute. You folks from out of town. You're the only ones with a reason to take our beloved cow memorial! Okay, that's enough o' that! You cows need to dis-perse!  All right, bad cows! Do you hear me? Bad cows!  All right, Ned. You're gonna have to bust out the whip! Holy smokes! Play dead, Ned! You hear that, cows? You're surrounded! There's no way out! Hey. Where's she going? That's the wrong way, you stupid cow! Yeap. They're dead, mayor. They're all dead. Oho, it was awful!  Cow after cow taking its own life, and we could do nothing to stop them! Oh, God! I hope so, Mayor. I hope so. Uhud I need a cold beer and a burger.  What's all the ruckus over there? Oh, hell, I have to run home and get my broom! Hey, aren't those the people we at first thought took the wooden cow? Aw, I forgot all about them. Ned, how the hell could you lose your voice box?!  I can't hear you, Ned. You don't have a trachea. You smoked too much and you had it removed. And then you drank too much and you lost your god-damned voice box, Ned! Aw, Ned, don't burp-talk. That just sicks me out. What the hell's goin' on?! Hold on, I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, come on!  Where did it go? Sounds like it ran into the ostrich trap!  Sshh. Now keep quiet. All right. I'm gonna turn my flashlight on. It may get startled, so be ready. Holy Crow! I've never seen anything like it! Well, let's kill it. Huh? Well, all right. Ned, get the Mayor on the phone, tell her that we... hoh yeah, he can't talk. All right, never mind, I'll do it. Yeah, it was like wrestling a Lousiana alligator, this thing. Put up one hell of a fight. Huh, cut it out, Ned! That's just disgusting! Hey Ned, look what I bought you! A new voice box!  You want it? You want it? Yeah! Do you? Yeah! You want it? All right, here you go.  Well, try it out! Oh, no, I must have picked up the Irish model by mistake. What? What is it? We just encourage them to find someplace better. Yeah. Let's get that luggage packed! Hey, Ned! A package came for you today from Voice Box Express. Close the door! The jakovasaurs would have gone extinct if we hadn't interfered. Because their particular form of life simply wasn't practical. Mhmm Ned, that voice box sucks! Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing. You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off. Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you. Well, enough of the lectures. let's get to boxing. Keep your guard up, Tweek! All right, looks like we'll have to apply the Oppenheimer technique with Tweek here. Punch him in the balls, Tweek!! Atta boy! Now quick, get him again while he's down! Good! Now kick his balls!  There, see? You've got him coughing up blood. Now THAT'S BOXING! ""Don't Sue People"" Panda? Well, I tell you what: we may not have Elway this year, but Brister won every game he started in last year. ...What?? Where is he?! Aw, hell, uh I've done it too. With Cameron here. Hwell... maybe a little. But we're all a little gay. Aw, nuts! Come on, Ned, this ain't no whore house, it's a hor-ROR house. Huwell, uh he's got a point there. Kyle, Kyle, he's our man. If he can't win it, I'm out 50 bucks. Sure! When it comes to spelling bees, always bet on the Jew. What?! Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee! You can do it, kid! You can do it! You little bastard, you cost me fifty bucks.  Why don't you run away and join the circus, you stupid little son of a bitch?! Aaargh! Eh, you wanna beer or something, Cotswolds? You what?? See ya, Cotswolds.  Thanks for stopping by. Because Cotswolds is gonna to live there. And when he shows up, we all grab him, bring him out here, and duct-tape him to the flagpole! Come on! We gotta buy more duct tape. Hey, there's Cotswolds. Come on! Let's duct-tape him to the flagpole! Well, come on, guys. If I'm not mistaken, we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole! Alrighty everyone. We just have a few things to go over before we head out to the reenactment battlefield.  First of all, I have great news. There are over 200 folks from around the state that have come to see this year's reenactment, and that's the best turnout ever! I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores. And now, to clarify how the reenctment should unfold, let's bring up our master historian, Grnandpa Marvin Marsh,  the only man old enough to have actually seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924. Now remember, everybody: for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed. ...And with that, let's all go to Tamarack Hill and put on a good show! Forward! Fire! Alrighty everyone.  We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. Now, I know you're just trying to help, Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time. Wuh. Well, 'cause we're supposed to lose. What?? By God, he's right! Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenacters have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenacters! Well, I'm sick of it! And I say it's high time we kicked some ass! Who's with me?! Surrender your men, general! SURRENDER YOUR MEN, GENERAL! The South wins! Well, we can all be friends now.  Come on, Randy. Have some s'more schnapps. Aw, come on. Have a little sip. Huh? They don't?! You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around! I'll bet we could, too! What?!  Is that a challenge?! I'll bet we can! Pussies?! Oh yeah?! Men! It's time to show the world what the Confederate Army has got! We're gonna take Topeka once and for all! All o' you men. You may have lost in the Union today, but join us now and win back your pride! Let's go! Ccchhhhaaaarrrrggggeeee! It's ours, it's ours! We've taken Topeka! Give me some more s'more schnapps! I'm gonna be sick.  Blouach. Hey! There's some more schnapps over here! Medic! Where to next, General? Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South Carolina. That's where the Civil War really escalated. Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. You want anything? Um, sure.  What the-? Ey, where's the s'more schnapps? I guess we drank it all. Ned, I think I can say without any doubt that that was the longest drinking binge we've ever had. Well, come on everybody. We've got to get to the nearest bus station, quick. We're goin' home kid. Come on. Yeah? Well, I don't think the bus station is too far from here. Well, uh I guhess one little cheers is in order. Hey, look! Ned's doin' his trick again! You heard the General. Charge! We got it! The fort is ours! What do we do, General? We're outnumbered. Wow, look at that! The entire state of South Carolina showed up! Hey, government! You can't ignore our anguished cries anymore! You hear that?! You Government?! Boy, we really got the President by the balls. Good thing you have that videotape of him and Marisa Tomei. Hey! Who's that?! Ey, General, he's reenacting Jefferson Davis! You can't talk that way to a superior officer! All right! Well, I think we got what we wanted. Lincoln and Davis signed the treaty, General. The war is over. We thought you did. We followed blindly for thousands of years and we think the least God can do is show up for New Year's Eve 1999! Here he comes! Whoa, man. Mayor, it's about the South Park flag. We cannot change the South Park flag, Mayor! Chef, I respect you very much, but you have to understand that this has been the South Park flag since some of our ancestors, like my great-grandfather, founded this land! Chef, what about the baseball team, the Cleveland Indians, huh? Should they change their name because it's racist? No, because it's their history! And I'm telling you it WON'T! This is about history, kids.  If you don't have respect for your past, then you can never expect to- BIRD!  -then you can never expect to have a future. Nowadays, everyone wants to change mascots and flags because they're not  ""politically correct."" Well, where does it end? I mean, people are gonna start sayin' that the Denver Broncos are offensive to horses. And then we'll have to- a SQUIRREL!  Aand then we'll have to change everything, and pretty soon all our history will be forgotten. But to REALLY understand the South Park's flag's importance, you need to know about South Park's history. Ned here's a big history buff, and he can tell you the whole story. Ned? You sure? You boys go make me proud now and win that debate- Chris Peterson!  God-damnit, we missed him again! Don't change history! Huh? Uh hey now, uh. We don't want your support. We're not racists; this is about history. Don't change history! Ned, nobody's gonna vote for our side if it's the side those KKK members are on. Come on, we gotta put a stop to them. Alright, Ned. We've got to be careful. These are really evil men we're dealing with. Damnit Ned, doesn't that thing have a volume control? Let's say they should change the flag! I thnk we should switch sides! Look, we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us, right? So, whatever side we're on is the side that's gonna lose, right? So why don't we all say that we want the flag changed. That way, most folks'll vote to keep it the way it is. That worked perfectly, Ned. Jesus, Ned, these guys are completely nuts. That is the most insane thing I've ever seen. I can't believe those people are on our side. I mean, is our side that crazy?  Oh, hello, Chef. Big debate tomorrow, I guess.  Oh, Jesus, the robes! Chef, this isn't what it looks like. You've gotta listen to us! Ned, I'm starting to think that maybe history ain't worth defendin' sometimes. Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found myself on the side of Klan menbers. I've never had anything against blacks, Chef. We've been way too divisive over this, Chef. Maybe we can come up with a- compromise flagü¾³¤¼something that everybody can be happy with. I have to admit it, that is a lot nicer. Holy crow. Look, boys! A real live wild turkey!  It's tryin' to outsmart us! Come on, fellas! There it is!  Hey, hey! I saw it first! I get the first shot!  Here, turkey turkey. That's it. Thaaat's it! Gotcha! Aw, thank God you're alright, kid. It was an accident, I swear. Uh, is there any way we can make it up to you? Turkey shoot! Oh! Was that it? Was that it?! They did it! Hell, that's not fair! I should be able to say ""fag."" Uh oh. There he is! Kill him! Kill him!  Oh, wait, that's not him. Kern. O-kay. Huh?? Uh, I don't feel nothin'. Hhud. I don't feel... hello... wait... wait... Yes! Oh my God! Eric! Are you training that pony to plese you?! Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know. Alright, then.  Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis? Well, son, I think you have a pretty stupid plan there. Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter. Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: exploit that weakness. What do you see? No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill. Oo what's a Radiohead? Oh, Jesus, don't start singing, Ned! Nice thinking, young hunter. What? What?! Give me those!  Holy crow, he's right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out! Dear God, they're bigger than I ever imagined! Here you go.  Wow, those are great. Maybe I should go grab some beers, Ned. Ned, what- a-are you jackin' it? Well, stop it! Oh crap! Ned, for Christ's sake, stop jackin'! Damn, Ned, I've never seen that much cash. On what? Yeah, I wanted to order that theft alarm for my IT. Uh, that's okay, I'll stand. Yep, there goes the neighborhood. Oh. I don't take kindly to rich folk. Neither does Ned. I remember back in the day, RICH folk weren't alLOWED in South Park! Now thery're movin' here in droves! Yeah. How many rich people does it take to screw in a light bulb? None! They can hire people to do it for them! I guess we showed them! Lowercase t? Yeah. Next house we'll do a capital T, to show 'em we REALLY mean business! I guess we learned our lesson: you can't fight rich folk; they're just too powerful. ...Ghosts? What?? Let's get him! Hey everybody! AIDS is finally funny! Well that guy's just plain nuts. Well we don't know what else to do, Mayor! Play ball!  Steeeeee-riiike South Park Cows do it again! Hey Randy, can I borrow your uh... What the hell are they doing? Awwww. A ladder tuh... Oh... oh God. It shows how beautiful the innocence of a child really is. Ah I hate when the Mayor uses Christmas for her own political agenda.  Light the damn tree! Oh, finally! You just keep all your flag burnin' and your hippie-rock protest songs on YOUR side o' the town! Well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store. W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs. All right, that's fine! Because our war support songs will be a thousand times better! Yeah! The last thing these people want is a bleedin'-heart rock protest song! Well can't we stop them? Let's call the bank. It's a long shot. Let's go thirty one! Let's see it! We'll never give up! You bastards! Mr. Garrison, those are great pants. Uh, for what? No. Heeey, now that's not true. My shoes don't say I pound butt. We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, we should be uniting against metrophobes like these! Whoa, look out! Oh Jesus, it's burning! Oh my God! Old fool went down to the OC to try to reason with the other team, and he got served up somethin' fierce. Boy. You must really wanna take to to those Orange County kids now, huh Stan? Man, it is about to get crazy up in here. All right! I ain't turnin' queer. It's like some mystical evil force. Randy! Randy, you've got to get out of here! If they just trample this park, we'll be trapped! It's too dangerous! Anything else? Nice plan, kid, except there's one giant flaw. That hippie crowd is massive! How the hell are we supposed to get through it and reach the stage? They're in!"
"ANOTHER TOWNSPERSON","Nice gun, Mr. Garrison!"
"WENDY TESTABURGER","Officer Barbrady! Mr. Garrison is about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to find him! I know that she's hurt you, she's hurt a lot of people. YOU should have won that talent show. Good... You don't DESERVE to win, Cartman, and YOU know it! I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper! It's actually nothing more than 'Walden' with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out and Cartman's name written in its place! Well not if it's CARTMAN!! Hey where are you all going?! (Vanquished) They don't even know what Walden is. (Shouting again) I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was!!! Oh, what the hell."
"KATHIE LEE GIFFORD","Thank you! How I love you all! (Still mostly inaudible) It is with great honor and pride that I present the winner this trophy. Eric, would you please come up here. AAAAGGHH!!!"
"SERVICEMEN","GUN!! GUN!!"
"T.V. CREW DIRECTOR","I guess that's it guys. Wrap it up. Forget it, kid. No Kathie Lee, no public interest."
"MAYOR","(Sobbing) NO!! NO!! Now I'll be stuck in this podunk town forever with all these stupid, hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!! We are quite aware of your concerns, Chef, but- My Geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check up. Don't you think I know that?! How dare you insult my intellect! I went to Princeton for God's sake! You get out of my office!! Just send in the Geomotrist! YOU ARE FIRED BUDDY! What does this mean to the town? My God... Oh, oh, this IS Big! (Through intercom) Johnson! Johnson are you there?! Ted, we have got a MAJOR crisis here! I want you to get on the phone, and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911, oh and Entertainment tonight. And you better get my stylist on the phone, too. Don't worry, things are under control. All we know right now is that some of our children are camping on that mountain, and. I'm sorry can I start over? Well you can edit this, right? Ready? 3,2,1 - ""All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can't do anything until we get them."" Okay people! Let's go get those kids! (Seeing she's on camera) Is it on? OK, Okay, people! Form groups and search the mountain! Report back here every hour! You got that? Oh, what? And... that would be good, right? Well what are we waiting for! Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels! God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2,and 1: God, please deliver... What is that thing? Hmnn, Where exactly does the Canyon go? Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you, Scuzzlebutt. Oh, how sweet! Turn off the cameras. Why... Why Chef, what a surprise! Well, I can assure you that it has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the Japanese Mafia You mean Tina Yothers? Well, let's get back to it. Okay, now once we have all the canned foods collected... We'll need some clever way to distribute them to the poor... Ah... You're that insane genetic engineer from up on the hill, right? (Skeptical) Uh-huhhhh.... (Still skeptical) Of course. (Still Skeptical) Nnnaturally... Oh do go on. You were saying? Oh, my... Now why would you say that? So, how does this thing work? Pov? Oh, brilliant! Aaaah! What the HELL is THIS? Okay, people, don't panic. Bring out the defense squad! Alright everyone, it's time to give out canned food to the poor. Looks like we have the turkey problem under control. It's time to embrace the spirit of giving with the canned food grab! (To Kenny) Come on. Hurry up! HAPPY HAPPY THANKSGIVING. LET'RRRRR RIP!!! C'MON, GRAB THOSE CANS LITTLE BOY!! Now let's see all the goodies you're gonna take home to your family!! It looks like he got a... a can of string beans! Chef! The turkeys! People... We all have to do our part against the evil turkeys... Come on, where is that Thanksgiving spirit? (To Assistant) Does my hair look okay? Okay, everybody, settle down! (Quieting them again) Okay, people... Clearly we need to reach a compromise... Perhaps we need a new icon for Christmas. Excuse me? Anyway... I'll put together a crack team of my best workers to make sure this will be the most non-offensive Christmas ever to any religious or minority group of any kind. Are there any other suggestions? Yes, Mr. Garrison? No, Mr. Garrison, we cannot get rid of all the Mexicans. Okay people we've got to turn this place around! Take down anything that is offensive to any specific group! (Calling out) Is anyone offended by mistletoe? Lose the mistletoe! Oh my God, what the hell is that thing? (Still staring out window) I noticed!!! CALL THE NATIONAL GUARD!!! We'll get you, you bitch... And to think, I actually WATCHED your HBO special... Officer Barbrady... Let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town. What would HE do? The press is here! You certainly made it up here quickly. Really? (Ignoring this) Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do? Shh! Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous? Well, in that case, I guess it's okay. Yes... We're TRAPPED. My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen. But how do we decide... who? We're all going to die in this horrible place. Yes... Of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts. Well, there's no going back now... We're cannibals. God save us. My God what a harrowing tale of human drama this is! All of us doing what we must to survive. But... How will we live with ourselves now? I don't believe it... All this time Barbrady actually did keep this town peaceful. He is... (holding up her hands) No reason for concern. I want to assure all of you -- that Officer Barbrady is STILL our active police force. Uh, plan? I don't actually -- Yes, that's right. It's back to school with Officer Barbrady! OFFICER BARBRADY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! Well, how's the reading coming along?! Barbrady... We really need you to speed this up. The chickenfucker struck again last night. The perpetrator left this clue at the crime scene. You have to learn to read faster, Barbrady! Listen, buddy, either you learn to read QUICK or else I'm going to find a law officer to replace you FOREVER!! Here she comes! It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park. Wow, look at this, Johnson. Traffic jams at every intersection, hordes of people pushing their way through the crowd. It's almost like we're a real city. They're Hollywood! They can do anything! Excuse me, Mr. Film Commissioner, could I have a word with you? Well, the people of my town are a little upset. I don't think we realized what an impact this festival would have on our town. Right. So, we were actually wondering if we could call this whole thing off? Ooh, yeaah. Now all we have is a town covered in shit! This is much better! You're telling me that students from Mr. Garrison's class actually did something that had some kind of relevance to the world? Mr. Garrison, the guy with the puppet? Well, I must say, Garrison, perhaps you're not as stupid and crazy as I always tell people you are. Well, I can't just shut them down, this is a free country. Look, the best I can do is create a proposition. We'll call it Prop. 10. The town can vote on it, and if it passes, we'll see what we can do. So I guess you wanna do some campaigning. You can do commercials and things like that, and then we'll have a vote in the middle of town. And obviously, if more than 50% of the people even show up, ""Search for underpants, hey! All right, what's next. Tomorrow, for the Prop. 10 vote, we'll set up ballot booths ...here.  All right, men, we'll throw up the stage here. Before the vote we'll get a band everyone likes, like uuuuhh, like... Like Toto. And then the Harbuck's guy will have five minutes to speak and the boys will have five minutes to speak, and then the town votes. Aalll right, people. The next order of business is a very serious matter. We need to vote on whether South Park should reinstate the death penalty or not. All those in favor, say ""yippee."" All those opposed, say ""nay."" Not now, kids. Thw town is having a very important debate on capital punishment. What the hell is going on here? Reward? What reward? Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your socks off. Holy crap! He's alive?? Well, quick, do something! Well, you just can't let him die. Ooh, yes. How are you? Right over here. What? Oh, neato. Hope. Why, that's a perfectly beautiful name! No, Garrison, you'll just try to have sex with it! Garrison, you remember what happened to the wounded pigeon you were supposed to take care of?! Here with more on the status of the jakovasaurs is Department of Interior guy. And now, the little boy who first discovered the jakovasaurs, Eric Cartman! We'll just leave you two lovebirds alone. She's a cannon! Now, folks, I know we're all a little worried about the jakovasaurs, and I want to hear you all out! All right, all right. It's obvious we have to do something, but we can't just make them leave. But where? Jakovasaurs are big, loud, annoying, and stupid. Where would they fit in? Yes, Memphis.  You jakovasaurs would love it there. But everyone in South Park wishes they could live in Memphis. Right? Now what do we do? You have? You can't leave. Come onn, come on!  Hello! Yes. Yes, Jakov. You're calling about the game show. Congratulations! Will you do it?! Of course! That's the point! Just be ready this afternoon at the public access building, and good luck! Hope you win!! We've got 'em! All right. The boys here will keep little Eric Cartman distracted. Meanwhile, we get rid of the jakovasaurs and bring some normalcy back to this town! Ready? Now remember, Barbrady, all you have to do is lose! Okay. Let's quiet down, people and jakovasaurs!  Now, as you know, the winner of this little game will get an all-expense paid trip for himself and fifty of his closest relatives to lovely France!  And, all one of you lucky constetants has to do is answer only one of these questions! Are you ready, players? Okay. Hands on your buzzers. You have to wait until I ask the question first. That's okay. Hands on buzzers. Will somebody please unplug the God-damned buzzers?! Now, can we get on with this? First question: What color is blue? What? What? Blue is-? Nono. Hang on.  You're supposed to lose, you idiot! Just don't answer any more questions, got it? Sorry, folks, a little mix-up. We're playing best out of three! What's two plus two, Jakov? Jakov, what is your name? Oh, screw it. Jakov wins! You and your entire family are going to wonderful and exotic France! All right, everybody. Let's get them to the airport!  Let's go, people! There's no time to lose! I know it's hard, Eric, but I've learned something today. You see, animal species come and go. It's all a part of natural evolution. Well, then. What say we all go get some ice cream! People, please! We can only speak one at a time. Now, Mr. Garrison, you were saying... Alright, people, Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose were nice emough to stop by to talk to you. Gentlemen? O-kay, people. I know this Chinpuku Man fad is causing a lot of problems. But I think we've already found a solution. Children are fickle.  All we have to do is come up with a new fad. We find the next toy and turn them all onto it as soon as possible. All right, everyone. Welcome to the 15th Annual South Park Spelling Bee Finals!  This should be very interesting. We have with us twelve of the brightest spellers from South Park Elementary. And, joining us this year, are the two home-schooled children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswolds! Our first contestant is Mark Cotswolds, from home school.  All right, Mark. Your word is ""conscientious."" Closely attentive to details. Careful.

Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants hold up the flag.  and you tell me what exactly you find racist about it. Oh, boy. Oh brother, what now?! Ooh, Jesus. What a mess. Chef, we realize that you find the South Park flag racist, and we certainly understand your case.  We have been diligently working on this problem, put in a lot of hours, and we have finally altered the flag in a way that we think will make you very happy. Gentlemen?  There. Is that better? No, but look! He's got a little smile now!  See? He's happy. Much better, don't you think?  Well, some people just won't with you at all. This is getting out of hand. How do I absolve myself of an responsibility with this? Yes, of course. Let the children be responsible. Everybody loves children. Tell the press. South Park Elementary will be holding a vote on Friday! What? This has been an interesting week in South Park. We've all done a lot of growing this week.  Everyone was afraid to take a stand on this issue. But now we have learned once again that black, white, yellow, brown, or whatever, we are all just people. And so, I am very excited to unveil our new South Park Flag! Ogh! This is terrible, Johnson! Our whole town's economy is going right in the toilet! We've got to get everybody back in the Christmas spirit! Meugh. Send them in. You do? An animated Christmas card. Kids, that just may be the dumbest idea I've ever heard, ever! But at this point I'm willing to try anything. Johnson, cut them a check for three hundred dollars. This kids better make a good Christmas movie, Johnson. If people in this town don't start shopping again, we're all gonna be out of jobs next year. It's alright, we've got a clean-up crew coming. Oh. Mr. Haneky, it's you. How wonderful. Citizens of South Park, the Colorado Film Commission is pleased to present to you a work by some of our very own South Park children. We know tha after you see this darling short film,  you will all feel the mighty glow of the Christmas spirit once again. Boys? Uhuh, just hang on folks. We seem to be having some technical difficulties Well, thanks a lot, kids. Great idea you had there. Now everyone is more disenfranchised with Christmas than ever. We want our three hundred bucks back! Fine. Then we'll sue you.  Johnson? They're starting to understand, Johnson. Hey, the shops are still open. We still have time to shop. Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How would you like to have your own show and make 100 more of them?"

And then it would bypass South Park pretty much completely! I'm pretty sure! And my calculations worked! The lava is following the trench into the Canyon! Uh..."

"NEWS ANCHOR","The people of South Park are humble and friendly. But now, a ticking time bomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful, burning agony. Mayor, what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe? Huh? And in other news, it appears that Saddam Hussein has finally signed an agreement to let the US inspect his military operations. When asked if he would uphold his side of the agreement, Hussein replied, quote 'Hey, relax fella, you need a rest, guy'. And in other news tonight it appears that everyone is officially SICK OF CHRISTMAS!  In an SPC poll, 38% said they were fred up and tired of the holiday, 5% said they were indifferent to it, and a whopping 57% they would quick Bon Jovi square in the balls if given the opportunity. Well, the holiday spirit may be gone from South Park, but at least our faith in each other remains strong. Oh really? ... but Hillary Clinton's ass just keeps getting bigger.  Also in the news tonight, a vandal has apparently cut off and stolen the head of the Powell statue in the South Park Town Square. The head was taken in the early morning hours and the police have no leads. This act, of course, reminded us all of the time that Bart Simpson  took the head of the Springfield statue in one of their classic episodes. Here's what some people had to say: The police say that instead of looking for the missing head, they'd rather leave it off and be reminded of the Simpsons every day. And in other news, still no known cause of death found for elementary school teacher Diane Choksondik. However, doctors say that during the autopsy they did find semen in her stomach. The autopsy is ongoing and cause of death is yet to be determined. And in other South Park News, elementay school teacher Ms. Choksondik's  autopsy has shown that the semen in her stomach belongs to school counselor, Mr. Mackey. However, the semen apparently did NOT contribute to the death, and so Mr. Mackey's identity is to remain anonymous. Our top story tonight, the age-old question has been answered: if I put food up my ass, will I crap out my mouth? All over the country, people are discovering that, yes, in fact, you will.  The sugeon-general had this to say: The Surgeon-General's response has made Americans change their eating habits almost instantly. The Mayor of South Park has announced that for first discovering this healthy way of eating, young citizen  Eric Cartman will be given... a freaking medal. This was the second time a terrorist threat has been made on a theme park, leaving everyone to realize that children are not safe outside. And it seems there's a new danger to look out for: children who are taken by strangers. The bottom line: children are not safe... in their own homes! And this newest study reveals more about child abductions than we apparently knew before, Tom. And so all the residents of Manhattan are prepared to evacuate if Ms. Clinton's ass gets any bigger. And in other news, new findings on the increase in child abductions. The study shows that the most likely abductors of children... are the parents themselves!  The study reveals that nine out of every ten abduction cases are commited by the child's mother or father. The bottom line being that your children aren't safe, even from you! Finally, some good news tonight. It's been several days since any child abductions have taken place. The main reason: parents don't know where their children are."
"T.V. ANCHOR","As some people of South Park try desperately to save their mountain town, others look for the missing townspeople, but all must take every precaution necessary. It now looks as if the missing children are trapped in the path of hot, nasty lava! And now these humble people can rejoice and celebrate their jovial victory over nature. I'm getting word that the Chef of the school cafeteria wants to sing a song about this thrilling struggle of humanity. Mayor, what do you have to say about this wonderful outcome? Oh my God! What has he done?! Thanks Tom, police are requesting that if you see this little eight year old boy, you immediately kill him and burn his body. That's all for now."

No wait, that's subtraction... (Checking his watch) It's almost midnight. Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then again, I'm a hard man.

(to the crowd) Well, first of all I'd like to thank the town of South Park, the town that borne me and eventually will rob me of my life precious. Second, I'd like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read... Your days are numbered!!! And finally, I'd like to say that READING TOTALLY SUCKS ASS!! Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this -- Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage and because of this piece of SHIT, I'm never reading again! Oh, that was so touching! Oh I'm sorry Mayor, but I couldn't find the little man in the boat. Oh? Oh I like snakes. You light 'em and they grow and grow. Huh, I found him. Let's move along, people.

I want to apologize to all of you for what happened in there. In our competition for ratings we lost sight of why we got into show business in the first place. Actually, I was referring more to the pursuit of truth, but-well anyway, I can't wait to get back to my old show without all the glitz and the ratings and producers and- I sent her away. Our topic tonight is the rising temperatures in South Park. Let's go to the phones. Caller, you're on the air. That's not the topic tonight. The topic is global warming. Do you have an opinion on global warming? Okay! Thank you caller. Well, let's go to our first guest, Dr. Alphonse Mephesto.  Thank you for coming.

So, what happens at the millennium? Oh. Well. Yea. Believe in me and ye shall find peace. Well, what do ya want? Oh. Uuuh, llet me think about that for a minute.  JESUS Father, I need to talk to you. Please, Father, appear to me. Father, everyone is starting to pay attention to me again because of the new millennium. Huh-I'm kinda making a comeback! It's the millennium, Father. People want to see you. But dad, I think this may be my one big shot at a comeback. Just make an appearance. You can come down, sey 'hi' to a few people and can be back by 12:30. Are you there, God? ...I have given it much thought, my children, and you are right. After reviewing the Bible, it does indeed say that something very big is going to happen at the millennium. I have spoken to my Father in heaven, and he agreed that the millennium is significant to all of us. And ye who believe in me SHALL be rewarded!  So what we're going to do tomorrow night, New Year's Eve, 1999: we just got ROD STEWART to agree to play a comeback concert at the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, and you're all going! Hoh, I'm excited too. I think it will bring my Father's children back to their faith and back to mine eyes, for I an the Lamb of God. Hey, Rod, great to see you. Uh, the folks are sure glad you're playing. It's really given them a lot of faith in me again. I'm sure that together, we can make this millennium party the best New Year's bash ever! What? Poo pants? Yuh you pooped your pants? Oh Uh-n nurse? Mr. Stewart has apparently pooped his pants? What?? Oh no! Are you there, God? Father, will you please reconsider and show up tomorrow?  ...Hello? Alright, people. Are we ready to rock the millennium?!  Father in heaven, please let tonight's show go well. Please make them like it. Well, I tell you one thing. I sure as heck am excited. We've got about four hours to the new year, and so I think it's time to START IT UP! Ladies and gentelmen, as promised, Mr. Rod ""Do You Think I'm Sexy?"" Stewart! Oh no. Please, Father. Do something. Uh, folks, I'm afraid God can't make it tonight. Huh? He doesn't hate you, he hates me. He's gonna let me be crucified again. Well, yeah, but just because God doesn't answer your prayers doesn't mean he doesn't care about you. Well, God can't just answer every prayer and suddenly give you everything you want. That takes all the living out of life. If God answered all our prayers, there'd be nothing left for us to do ourselves. Life is about problems, and overcoming those problems.  A-and growing and learning from obstacles. If God just fixed everything for us, then there'd be no point in our existence.  That's why he wouldn't show up to my New Year's party. I get it now, Father. I had to learn all this on my own.  I was overcome with my new popularity and, and I let pride get in the way of good judgment. It's Dad. Father. You came. Yea, 'tis my Father, the Creator. He is the Alpha and the Omega.  The Beginning and the End. Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school. God doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising His name. God wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. That's how you live for Him. But Eric, I think this time I have to teach you a lesson! I'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins! No. Worse! Back to our courageous story of a little boy's triumph over obesity. Eric, yea. You found that the Spirit of the Lord inside you gave you strength. A little boy who overcame the odds. Let's hear it for Eric Cartman!  Well, our second guest tonight is a young man named Kenny McCormick, who is going to eat dog crap. Kenny? Thanks for coming on the show, Kenny. So. Kenny, how did you discover that you had this... talent? I can't say I approve of this, my children. Because Kenny is only doing things that anybody could do. For money. He's a prostitute. You have blemished the meaning of Christmas for the last time, Kringle! Christmas is for celebrating my birth! Of course. I know you, my child. Come in. You're good to bring this to my attention, Stan. Cults are a very dangerous thing. The miracle I'm most famous for is turning water into wine. Very well. I shall perform the miracle. Behold. Here you can see ordinary water, clear, clean. Okay now, turn around. Er, nuh, tur- turn around.  Uh, okay now, turn back.  It is now wine! Wuh well, yeah. Oh. Well, I guess it worked a little better on people 2000 years ago. Then let's go. Oh,don't worry  I have a few more miracles up my sleeve. Hold! My children, it is time for you to go home and stop following this false prophet. You should be using your money and time for other things. These are simple magic tricks. His magic is interesting, but will it put food on your table? Feeding the hungry - now that is a miracle! Behold! I havd here fives loaves of bread and three fish. Certainly not enough to feed this entire crowd, but now - turn around  Ya need tuh- turn around.  Okay, now turn back. Oh, really. Then what's this  Ace of Spades doing behind your ear? Jesus Christ! His magic is too powerful, Stanley. I've never seen anything like it. I cannot face him alone. We must get the help of all the super best friends. Buddha. Buddha, come in! Buddha, we may have a problem. I've just encountered a magic I've never seen before. Come, Stanley. We must travel far and long. Distances unfathomable to man. Yea, take hold of my robe, Stanley, and do not open your eyes. Are you still keeping your eyes clsoed? Good. Want some peanuts? Alright, Stanley. You can open your eyes now.  This is the hall of the super best friends, Stanley, the headquarters for those who stand for what's right. Stanley, I want you to meet some of the super best friends : Buddha, with the powers of invisibility; Mohammed, the Muslim prophet with the powers of flame ; Krishna, the Hindu deity; Jospeh Smith, the Mormom prophet; Lao Tse, the found of Taoism ; and Sea-Man, with the ability to breathe underwater and link mentally with fish. Here. I have a videotape of his performance the other night. Wait a minute. At his performance David Blaine said something about trying to get tax-exempt status. Not so fast, David Blaine! Yes! But this time, I've brought some help! Super Best Friends! The mass suicide is over, Blaine! And so are you! That takes care of them. We've gotta stop that oversized Abraham Lincoln! Mohammed!  Great Scott! There has to be a way to destroy it. Jesus to Moses! Come in, Moses! We need to know how to kill a giant stone Abraham Lincoln. You heard him, Super Best Friends! We've got to make a giant stone John Wilkes Booth! That should do the trick. Now for some concrete. Lao Tse, bring it to life. It worked. Now freeze over the pool so no one else can drown themselves! Your magic is no match for our powers combined, Blaine! Goddamnit! Oh, shut up, Buddha! In nome del mio padre, siete guarito. Il vostro bambino se arguisto. Stan, Kyle, Mr. Hankey and Eric Cartman. What are you doing here, my children? Santa? Is he alright? We have to get him out of there. Yes. Yes, I think I do.  We need a little Christmas miracle.  Lock and load! We're goin' in! He must be in that building below us. Land it on the roof, Mr. Hankey. Wait here, I can handle this. Yay, look upon me, and know me. My children, you should know something. I'm packing.  Let's go! Here.  Can you walk? There, they are healed.  Santa... Let's move. Move! Get up the stairs! The sleigh is on the roof! You're a... bad liar.  Yay. B-but we sure gave them one hell of a fight, huh? Uh Santa? Don't... don't ever... let them take away... our... Christmas spirit. Wa! Non. Non. Nono, non, non, WAAAAHH!!"
"MAN","Yeah, is this Jesus? This... this is Robert from Torrey Pines. I called last week asking for advice on my Ex-wife. Everything's much better, Jesus, she hasn't mouthed off since.

How I've missed them all. Little Nahlal. Nadia, my sweet Barshta Baltania, eh anyway, my heart is aching for their return. I, I know the American government will do what's right. We demand you release these men at once! We are NAMBLA, the North American Man Boy Love Association, and we heard about these political prisoners you're keeping? Loving young boys has been around since the time of the Romans, pal! There's nothing wrong with it! We are an organization dedicated to showing that sex between a man and a young boy can be a beautiful thing! Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer! All these men wanted was to love a young boy!  There is nothing wrong with love! You haven't heard the last of us, officer! Together we are strong.  Come on, men! Fellow members of NAMBLA. As you know, hn hn, we continue to be discriminated against. Recently, the FBI has started to arrest men, who are doing nothing more than trying to start a sexual relationship with a young boy. Hu-uh?! Nothin'. Just... shoppin'. Sure, I remember you!  You got it, baby. You got it, baby. What's happening here? Hm. Well, let's just walk away then. Aaawwwwwww! Where are we? Kelly, please. Don't do this. I'm sorry. I don't know! And me. How are we not to cry. Our hearts have been broken, our lives ruined, and now we are set to die! Panda bears make me sad. They're almost extinct. My father died in a stamp-collecting accident. We can't help it! You're bawlin' us to tears! I haven't seen a road marker for miles. What was the last highway we were on? Maybe you're reading the map wrong. What the?  Oh no. No, no, no, no. I have no idea. Oh, we're gonna have to find some help quick. We're not gonna make it more than a couple of miles. Well, it'll have to do. It's probably the only town for a hundred miles. ...Yes, we need a mechanic to look at our car. ...It's... just you here? Oh, good. Look we're in a bit of a spot here! I've got a very important job interview tomorrow morning in Breckenridge, so I have to get my car fixed fast! Is there another garage in town? How about a phone? Can we just use the phone? Fine! Can you take us there? Yes. Well, can you help us find the phone, please? Alright, let's just... go, Linda. I don't have time for Spaceman Spiff's little games. What? Look, there's an elementary school Come on, there might be some teachers inside. Linda, it's a remote-controlled car. Looks like maybe there's a little camera on it. See a movie? You know, it's just that a lot of people don't really believe in the whole Jesus thing anymore, you know? So what's to celebrate? Oh, that's Christmas for ya. Shit, Peter, you look like shit. Well how gay is he? Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my! Just let 'em have it out, Susan. They'll run out of steam soon. Alright, boys, break it up. Uh, uh, HOORAY! O-hoho! It's Jesus! Next! Yes? The pube fair?

We should have never crossed that picket line. Come on, honey. Oh, excuse me. I was just-  God-damned smartass! Do you think you could Look, I apologize Yeah, what what has Catholicism come to anyway? If there was a god, why would he let our kids be molested in the first place? You know, for Martha and I, we're, we're worried we might have a hard time raising our son atheist. I mean-  whoa, thank you -I mean,  it could end up being very difficult raising an atheist child in such a Christian society.  I feel that everywhere my poor son goes he's being persecuted for his beliefs. Hat McCollough. He was sent to prison in '82, and we believe he should be released! To do what? Relax, Tweek. I am not here to hurt you. I am the Ghost of Human Kindness. Spank that ass What does it mean? Hello there, Christopher. Let's go! Let's go! Well, so where are they? What's this all about, Mr. Smith?

"BIG GAY AL","Hello there, little pup. I'm Big Gay Al. Have you been outcast? Well then I'm so glad you found my big gay animal sanctuary. We're all big gay friends here. Would you like to live with us? Come on in, little fellow. Nobody will ever oppress you here... Hi, little fella, how are you doing today? I'm super, thanks for asking! Well... Let's see. Come on in! We have all sorts of gay animals here at Big Gay Al's. Over here we have a gay lion -- And we have gay water buffalo, gay hummingbirds -- here's a gaggle of gay gooses. Hi fellas, it's so super to see you! Of course they are silly buns! It's the one place where gay animals can really be themselves. Do you like to dance? Young man it appears you still don't understand. Come this way, I have to show you something. Okay Stan, I think you should get in line for my big gay boat ride. Step aboard, Stanly. Hello everyone, and welcome aboard the big gay boat ride. On this adventure, we'll be seeing the world of gayness throughout time. You see, Gayness has existed since the beginning of time... From the Egyptian Pharaohs... To the Shoguns of Japan... Oh, oh! Look out! It's the oppressors! Christians and Republicans and Nazis OH MY! Hoo! Oh gosh That was close! Okay let's steer our big gay boat out of here, and into a place where gays are allowed to live freely... So what do you think, Stan? Isn't this precious? No problem kids! Are you sure you don't wanna stay for some toasted cheese sandwiches? Oh Stan -- When you get back to town... Tell them about us, will you? Tell them there are gay animals here who need homes desperately. Ooh, my carrot cake! I want to thank you for bringing everybody here. I'm super, thanks for asking. It looks like now my work here is done. Goodbye, Stanly, peace be with you. Hellooo scouts. Hello, Stanley. I was happy to see you and your little friends' names on the list! I just got transferred in.  I think everyone's here now, so we can get started. Come on, Scouts. We've got work to do! Hey, are you parents gonna stand there all night? This meeting is for scouts only, you silly gooses.  Now, before we get started, scouts, I want to introduce you to someone very special here tonight. He's a brave little boy with disabilities who proves just by being here that Scouts are for everyone! So let's all give a big round of applause to little... Jimmy! And so that's how to make banana-nut muffins. And now, as a very special treat, our very special friend Jimmy is going to do what he loves most: motivational standup comedy.  Let's give him a big hand. Oops, guess we're out of time, kids. Now remember, tomorrow you all have bake sales in your respective neighborhoods to raise money. We'll meet back here next Tuesday, and see who raised the most. Good luck. Hiya fellas! I'm super, thanks for asking. The troops are off having bake sales, and I'm pleased to report that we have already raised over $600 for the event. Yippie! Well, stop the presses, did you figure that out all by yourselves, silly buns? Out of... Scouts? But I've been in Scouts since I was nine - it's a... huge part of my life. I see... Wull what if I promise not to be gay anymore?  Pinky swear. Right. Move on. Hm, bye, Scouts.  Okay, okay, Marc, stop playing now. I'm sorry. Sorry. But now I've packed everything wawy, so just... well, play something uplifting, like... ""I'm gonna put all this behind me and make it okay"" music. Ogh!  Jesus, Marc. Go away! I'm dead. I can't, kids. I've been... kicked out of Scouts. Really? Oo-why? Why not? Boys, umph, there's nothing I can do. The Scouts don't allow homosexuals. Thank you all very much. But I don't want this. Look, I appreciate what you kids did; really, I really do. But this isn't what I wanted. I'm proud to be gay. And I'm proud to be in a country where I'm free to express myself. But freedom is a two-way street. If I'm free to express myself, then the Scouts have to be free to express themselves, too. I know these men. They are good men. They are kind men. They do what they think is best for kids. No matter how wrong we think they might be, it isn't right for us to force them to think our way. It's up to us to persuade, and help them see the light, not extort them to. Please, don't cut the Scouts' funding. The Scouts help and have always helped a lot of kids. That's why I love them. I will continue to persuade them to change their mind, but this is the wrong way to do it. So, I am hereby dropping my case, and allowing the Scouts their right to not allow gays into their private club. Come on kids, let's go get some ice cream!"
"SPORTSCASTER FRANK","Hello everyone, this is Frank Hammond at South Park public radio AM 900, welcome to tonight's match up between the Middle Park Cowboys and the South Park Cows. Well, looks like Chef, the South Park Cows' coach is a little nervous... This is probably because his star quarterback has yet to show up. Filling in for quarterback is number 12, Kyle Broslofski. The ball is snapped... Middle Park Blitzes!! FUMBLE!! Middle Park gets the ball... They run it in for a TOUCHDOWN!! The score is seven -- nothing Middle Park with 14:57 remaining in the first quarter. I haven't seen a beating like that since Rodney King. Right, right, I gotta watch that... I haven't seen an Englishman take a blow like that since Hugh Grant. Sorry, sorry. And the South Park Cows are set to receive... There's the kick... It's taken by number 23, Kenny McKormik. He's at the 50! The 40! The 30! The little running back is DOWN! I think he's... Yes he's been decapitated! Ouch-a-roo! Looks like the South Park Cows aren't even going to beat the 72 point spread, not by a long shot. And now here to sing the touching song 'Loving You' is the one and only... John Stamos' brother!!! And these South Park cows are being absolutely MOLESTED by Middle Park. I haven't seen so many children molested since -- Well, this should just about wrap it up for -- Wait a minute, what's this? Stan hikes the ball... He steps back to pass!! And he throws it to Kyle, the little Jewish kid! Oh my! I haven't seen a Jew run like that since Poland, 1938! The clock runs out! And the Final score is Middle Park Cowboys 73, South Park cows six! South Park beats the spread. Stan, what do you want to tell the world about this stunning almost victory? Uh... Stanly you arrived very late in the game, where were you that whole time?"

You farted! Hey Phillip, would you like a flower? Alrighty then, here's a Tulip PUUU!! Terrance farts. You're an asshole, Phillip! Oh no, Phillip! looks like you're about to fart! Hey, Phillip, guess what? Hey Philip, would you like to eat some beans? Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart! Ha Ha charade I am. I don't know why don't you check -- Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like? Well, it smells like... A dirty fart! Hey Phillip. Is there a penny stuck in my butt? It sure does Phillip. Nobody will oppress our religion here! I sure am cold Phillip. Gosh, I hope we don't starve. Hey Phillip, could you pass the beans? I spattered his face. Hey Phillip, I have to go to Iraq and find my kidnapped daughter! Yes, Phillip, I'm making a case for our defense! Would you like a monkey claw, Phillip? That's called the monkey claw because it feels like my colon is being ripped apart by a thousand monkeys! Oh, Phillip, now you've farted during the closing argument. Oh, Phillip, you've saved me from the GAS chamber!! That sure was fun Phillip, let's go home and eat Kraft Dinner! Head cancer? Wow! Scott really hates us, Phillip. But we're not gay, Phillip. Well, let us board the subway and return home. There we can eat Kraft dinner. Say Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week. God only knows. It sure is. Let's look for treasure. Well, it's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip. My God you're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob. Because you're God damned ugly, Bob. No it isn't. Wanna see what's on the inside of me? Yes, if people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are! Sure you can, Ugly Bob, if they can't see how horribly disfigured you are, they'll want to sleep with you. You know I never turn down Kraft Dinner, Phillip. I'm going to go put on a pirate costume. I'll take that. Shiver me timbers Phillip! At this rate, I'll never get to my Kraft dinner! Oh my God! No, it's Sally. She's being held captive in Iran! My daughter. Oh, yes. Didn't I mention that, me hearties? Oh. Well, it all began fifteen years ago... Yes, indeed. But now my little Sally is being held captive in Iran. And I will have to go and find her. You are such a good friend, Phillip. A lass there maties! Hello, Celine Dion. You're looking well. Celine, where is our daughter Sally? Wrong. She's been taken hostage, and is now being held prisoner. Phillip and I are going to Iran to find her, but we may never return. We just grew apart Celine Dion. Ha ha ha ha ha!!! How's the paper bag working out? Terrific. We need two tickets for Teheran, please. Indeed, Phillip. Same here, Phillip. (singing) With glowing hearts we see thee rise, The True North strong and free! Oh, Phillip, how will I ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place? We don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers, and we have no idea where to begin! Oh look, there she is. I'm here, Sally. It's your father, Terrance. I'm here to save you from your smelly Iranian captors. Well, enough of Iran, let's get home. Well, now that I have my bastard daughter back, I feel like going back to Celine Dion's house and asking her to marry me again. No, you're gaining a pop vocalist. It seems to have changed... What's going on, Terrance? How could Canada have changed so much whilst we were gone? I must take my bastard daughter back to Celine Dion, and she what she has to say. Celine, I've brought our daughter Sally back. And I want to tell you that -- You've got a MAN over, don't you Celine Dion!! What the hell are you doing here?! Oh Celine Dion, what have you done?! I was going to make us a family again but now you've slept with ugly Bob! Look at him, Celine Dion! WHAT?! NOOOoooo!! Phillip, I'm convinced that something very very not good is happening to Canada. Oh, hello Scott. Hey Scott, guess what? Agh! Stop that! Yes! We can get satellite feed from the U.S. and watch all of their stupid T.V. shows! They look like groundhogs! Hey Phillip, isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town? Well we can't just sit here and eat Kraft Dinner and let Canada been overrun by the Turks. It sure did Phillip. Oh wait, that is the phone. Hello? Oh. (to Phillip) Hey, it's Scott. Phillip says hello, Scott. You are such a dick, Scott. YOU'RE a dick. YOU'RE a dick. ... YOU'RE a dick. Oh, I'm sorry Scott, could you hold on a minute? Ahhh!! How do you like that, Scott?! Oh, wait, I have another call, Scott, can you hang on? Oh, wait a second, Scott. Well, Scott said to meet him here, but now he's not showing up. Oh, good idea! Let's search for treasure! We're looking for treasure! Yes, you mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the tele. That sounds scary. For Canada, Phillip. Well, Phillip I am very sad that we have to die for Canada. Why is that? Yes, apparently he does. Oh, Phillip, it sounds like you have an idea. Well, I guess it's time, old friend. Now, Phillip? WE DID IT, PHILLIP! WE'VE DESTROYED THE TURKS!! Oh, it was all Phillip's idea! Hey Scott, do you like apples? How do you like THEM apples?! Oh, Celine Dion... You never finished that National Anthem. Sure thing, Phillip.  Ah ha ha ha, you got me again! Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news. The good news is, you have a clean bill of health. The bad news is, you have cancer. Yes. I'm afraid your ass is collapsing. Yes. See this X-ray?  That's your ass. See this line?  That's your ass collapsing. Your ass is collapsing. No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore. We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope. I am, Phillip. I am. Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass. Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better. Hey, Phillip, pull my finger. Hurgh. Oh, wait wait wait. Pull harder. Hurgh, urgh.  Damn it! Pull really hard, Phillip! Hurgh-rrh. Waiwait, wait wait. Hrhrhrhrh. Aha! Hr-rhrh. Oh my! Yeee-aaa!  Hurh. Uhwaiwait.

I don't see anything. I still don't see anything, Phillip. AAHahahahahahaaa! Why, did you fart?  Oh, no! Sure, buddy! All you need to do is go down to the , and that's how you  get to the auto garage! Sure. You go the same way  except stick your finger up your ass. OOOH! Sure! Just stick your finger up my ass. You're at the auto garage. I am the mechanic. Because I had an itch up my ass. Terrance & Phillip will be right back... Hellooo, Den-ver! How are we all feeling tonight? Pretty good?  Uh oh.  Hey, do you all remember this one? And now, for some classic Terrance and Phillip comedy! Hello Phillip. Say, Phillip, I have a question for you. And now here's a classic Terrance and Phillip sketch that I wrote back in '62. He sure did. Who. Who! Who passed gas! That's the man's name? Yes! Right, the guy that drank his own urine. Mmm. Mmm, yummy.  Mmm. We sure did, baby.  Next? You're a huge fan alright! But what do I get in return? Oh yeah.  Oh, that's good, baby. You like that? Yeah. Ah good. Yeah- Jesus Christ! That was fast! Well, what should we name it? How about Jerry? Oh wow! We had quadruplets! Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids.  What do you want, an autograph or something? Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay? Who? Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, ""Hey, where's Phillip?"" Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK! You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines! Ah, I know.  I know he sucks  To be honest, things haven't been going so well lately. I'm not making any money because everyone wants to see Phillip. Why? What the hell does Phillip do? Ogh, whatever.  The point is, Phillip and I are through.  And apparently, so is the act. And so is the money. HA! Goood luck getting Phillip! He left because he wanted to do  ""more serious"" stuff. Last I heard, he was doing Canadian Shakespeare in Toronto. Well, in that case, I'd say you four boys are up Fart Creek without a paddle. Alright, I'm here. Where do I-? My doing?? These kids called me and said it was your idea and that you wanted to apologize. Ditto! Doctor, doctor, I've cracked my ass. Look closer. Uh. What? That's not the line, asshole! Just do the bit right, dickface! I may be fat but at least I didn't get hair plugs! I never needed you in the first place, yuh hack! Here's a missile for ya! I don't know, Phillip. It looks like the alien species here breathe an inert gas. What's going on here? Oh, Phillip. You're still here, too. Me neither. We sure did. No. No, Phillip, don't say it. I was an asshole, and this is mostly my fault. No, Phillip, I really thought I did everything. Until I- tried to do it alone. Thank you everyone, thank you! You know, Phillip and I have learned an important lesson: that when you go through a lot with somebody, you can't let trite things come between you. Ohohoho, nohoho! God no!  Oh, Phillip, your anthrax has given me colon cancer! Ey! There's some anthrax over there! Hello there, Phillip. I brought you something Phillip, I think I may have accidentally killed Celine Dion. Wait, before you do, pull my thumb. Hey Phillip, guess what?"
"SHELLEY","Hey! Are you looking at my head gear? Are you looking at my head gear? You little liar! I swear I'm going to kill you Stan! Are you staring at my neck brace? You'll never be bigger than me, Stan. NEVER! What the hell do you want? Oh boy, you are gonna GET IT now!!! It's not Stan's fault. It wasn't Stan, he was... he was with me the whole time. That show's for babies, it's so stupid! JESUS CHRIST! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!?! No, I mean what the HELL ARE YOU DOING TO GRANDPA?! You little jerk, you were trying to kill grandpa!! I'm telling mom!! Oh, whoo-peee! Shut up, brat! Stop it! Serves you right, you little brat! If I die from this, I'm taking you with me. We're watching this. Give me the remote! Thank you, Aunt Flo. What do you say, Stanley? Okay. Ew! You're gonna get it now! Ooooo, Stan's in trouble! Okay. I charge $5 for the first hour, 5% bumps every hour after that up to six hours, which enters into golden time. Bears? Alright, turd, listen up! Now that your mom is gone, I'm in charge. I don't know how you treat your other babysitters, but when I'm babysitting, you're nothing but a little turd. You're a stinky dried-up stupid turd! Got it?! My boyfriend is coming over, so you go to the kitchen, and you make us that pizza before I snap you in half like the little turd-stick you are! Move! Figure it out, turd! ...So I said, ""you're a little turd!"" and he w- ...But when you've seen one turd, you've seen them all.  ...stupid turd! The one night- Oh. Hold on a second, Carrie. I placed his underwear over his head. Well, I'm watching Friends, turd!  That's my boyfriend. Go answer the door while I make sure I don't have food in my braces. Hey, Skyler. He's my boyfriend! He's 22! You're a turd! You're the Turdman of Alcatraz! Turd wedgie. Come in the kitchen, Skyler. There's refreshments No, Skyler. Quit it. Eight days tomorrow. I don't know, Skyler. It's just kind of strange to me that you're 22 and all. Well, maybe just one kiss. Go on, Astroturd! Turd Rock From the Sun! We left you some crusts! Guess again, Richard the Turd! You're such an amazing poet, Skyler. Skyler, not here. Really? Wow! O Skyler, I love you. What the-? Give me that picture! Open this door, Turdledove! Your mom doesn't get home for three more hours! That's plenty of time for me to make a turd sandwich out of you. Give me that picture, turd! I'm gonna bust this door down! Who is that?! Skyler, your band can't practice here. Just keep the volume down! I have to go deal with Turdboy. Hey Eric! Your mom's been in an accident! We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back. Not really. She's dead. Haha! That was a turd trick. Your mom isn't really dead! HAha! I knew you sent the cat, and that's why I went outside and got him! You mean this one? Honestly? I think you guys need some work. I just think your sound is kind of... last week. Well, I do have a song I wrote. Nnno, Skyler, I'm embarassed! Uhwwell, okay.  I'll try. But I'm not promising anything.  1 2 3 4 Life so full of happiness? In a world that's full of turds. TURDS! We're going outside to watch a meteor shower! I'm locking you in your room 'til we get back in, turd! Wha-? What the hell is wrong with you?! How come you're not yelling and whining?! What?! No you don't! ...Oh, all right, get your turd coat. You can come see the meteor shower with us. But don't bug me and Skyler! Come on! Shut up, turd! What are you doing? Go away, turd! No. NO! No, Skyler, I'm not putting out for you! 'Cause I'm twelve! No! What?? But I thought you liked me. I don't care.  He acted like he really liked me. Nobody's ever liked me before. I can't believe I trusted him. I'm so stupid. Nobody my age would go out with me 'cause I'm too ugly. You don't think so? You're right! He is a scumbag! I wish I could get him back! I just don't know how. Huh? Really? You would do that? This won't take me long! I'm almost done. Thanks for all your help, Eric. You know, as far as turds go, you're okay. They're having a cat orgy! Your mom's gonna get home soon. We're gonna get busted! Come on! We've got to get the house clean before your mom gets home.  You know, Eric. It's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends. No! It's Eric's fault. He let those cats in here. Wow, she passed out. Well, let's clean up the house. Looks like everything turned out o-kay. I saw three ships come sailing in Geez, what's up Dad's ass? Mom, what's up Dad's ass? Ooo, Stan's in trouble. Let me kick his ass, Mom. Let me hit him, Mom! Shut up, turd. I'm watching Buffy. The Russell Crowe Show? You turds don't even like that show! That's stupid! See you turdy critters some other time! No, turds! Shut up, fat turd!! We're not watching this! There is one thing I love more than Russell Crowe, and that is seeing you unhappy. So, Buffy it is! All right. I just started my period, and I need tampons. If one of you turds will go buy them at the store for me, you can watch your stupid turd show with your stupid turd movie commercial in it! And they'd better be here when I come back downstairs, turds! I told you I needed tampons, tuurrddsss! Shut up, turd! We're watching Friends! I said shut up, turd! I wanna watch TV. My brother is a stupid turd. Me neither. I hate this family, I hate it! Oh, you stupid turd! Shut up, turd! I'm watching television! I said shut up, or I will destroy you, tur-r-rd! STOP CRYING, TURD!! Now, who's gonna kill you? Oh, you are such stupid turds. Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd is going to kill you. That's my job. Yes, but I'm gonna want something in return. SHUT UP, TURD! You're going to admit to Ms. Claridge what you did! You can't run from your past, turds. Apologize and make amends. Then I'll protect you from this Trent turd."
"NERDS","Yeah a gay pig too! Stupid gay pig. Yeah... they're all gay."
"ELTON JOHN","Ooh tonight, all is right, ooh tonight is right for love, love gravy."
"BIG STAN","Me Bad? Bubba chewy chomp!!! Cha waaha waah. Haa Cheww weee. Ba chomp Ba chewy chomp. Bubba chomp... Ba chewy chomp. Haa Ba Chew Me bad? Ba chewy chewy chomp... Uh."
"NEWSMAN","It appears that the horrible, destructive creature is actually eight year old Stan Marsh of South Park. When asked why he was wreaking such havoc on his home town, the little boy replied simply 'Me Stan, bu chomp ba chewy chomp ba chewy chomp'... Back to you in the studio."
"EVIL STAN","BA CHOMP!! BA CHEWY CHOMP!! He was here! Cartman was just here! Aha! There you are, Cartman! Hey! What's wrong with you, Cartman? What the hell's goin' on?! Cartman never hits us! Yes! Thought you could get away from us, huh, Cartman?! It's time, Cartman! Prepare for gingerification! The gingerification gun! Give me that gun, kid! Noooooo!"
"DAD","Huh? Oh... Well, Stan we're... We're sorry we jumped to conclusions... Good to see ya again, son. With who? Oh. Your mom and I are going out for a few weeks, Kenny. Take care of the baby. You have to share your room with the baby! The baby! :	 Well, don't you worry, Scott. Your mom and I can go get the pony and have it taken to an animal shelter. Let's. Oh, is it soneone's anniversary soon? Just kidding.  Oh, I wonder what it is. Well, looks like we're gonna have to do somethin' extra-special for Mommy and Daddy's anniversary this year. How about on Saturday we all go have dinner at Bennigan's! Well, if you two will excuse me, I need to go and buy a certain special lady her anniversary present. I'll be back in a little bit.  Butters, you're in charge of the house. Well, honey, you've painted the entire house. Three times. Say Butters, m-I'm havin' real trouble finding an anniversary present for Mom. Any ideas? Well then, it looks like I'm gonna have to go out shopping again. I'll be back in a little while. OOH! BUTTERS!! Oh God! Aaah! Ohhh! Butters, you need... to leave here right now! You need to... get out of here, egeh... Go home and wait for me to talk to talk to you. Oh, Jesus, no. OH, what have I done? Butters!  Oh Butters! Could you come and see me in my study real quick? Come here, son.  I wanna have a talk with you. Son, I wanted to talk to you about lying. Yes, it sure can be.  But, there are also times when distorting the truth a little ih, is appropriate. These are called ""little white lies."" Ya see, sometimes telling a little white lie is okay. Like, for instance, when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house. Butters, the point is that, I think that if you told Mommy what Daddy was doing tonight, weh, she might go completely insane. It won't? Oh, good. You... what? Linda?? What are you doing?? Linda, I know this is very hard- I've been wanting to stop going to those places, Linda, but I couldn't. I still love you! It just... it started as some curiosity on the Internet. I would chat with other married goes in the chat rooms and... Well the things they woudl talk about, Linda, I, I don't know why I found it exciting. I just did, and it, and it grew from there and it spun out of control, and- eh, ugh, DAMN YOU, INTERNET! No, Linda! I don't want that lifestyle! It's just kind of an addiction. I want help. And I'm going to get help. Please, just give me a chance to make this all up to you.  We can have a normal life! Sure there is! What? Okay, my turn.  Ooo, five!  One two three four five. Uh, awww, lost yor mortgage, pay ten thousand dollars! Oh no! Hi Stan! Well, it's great you could join us for Family Home Evening, Stan! Hey kids! Why don't you grab your instruments and play a song for Stan! Oh boy! Who is the best Mom in the world?? All right, kids, now how about we do some Scripture readings! From the Book of Mormon! All right, you rascals. Gather round. Joseph Smith lived in a little American town in the early 1800s. And we all know what happened then, don't we? Hey gang, let's wrap some more of them up in plastic wrap and hand them out to the poor! Awww, that's too bad. Well, it was really nice meeting you, Stan. Jimmy? Jim, it's your father! Jimmy, were you masturbating? Okay. Well, you have a visitor. I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Jim. I'll leave you two alone.  Y-you sure you weren't masturbating, Jim? It's okay if you were. Okay then. Here I am, Blanket!  Heeee!  Jeh chabee durtah!  Blanket!! Oh my beautiful blanket! Hi, sweetie. What's the matter. Oh? ...Gosh. Well, we'll get right on fixing that, sweetie. Wanna watch The Price is Right? What?! No daughter of mine is going to dress like a whore! We're marching down to that store right now, young lady!"
"MOM","Oh honey, please forgive us son. Oh golly, Kevin honey. Kenny , You share that blanket with your brother! It's true. I was. Well what, honey? Yes, I think that's right. Don't just ""Oh"" him, Thomas! You can't eat, Kenny. We have to save food for the baby. Kenny, you have to change the baby's diapers! The baby. The baby!! Oh dear. We sure can. Oh, Scott, you're such a loving, caring boy. I'm so proud of you. Let's go, hon. He's cute, isn't he? Oh, you! Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days. I hope he means me, haha. Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year? Every year it's the same. Your father gets me some great gift and my gift to him falls short.  I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to. Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me. No, it's a little different. You remember when the nice policeman gave yuu a badge and made you an honorary inspector? Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing.  What do you say? Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around? Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary? A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself. Wait a minute. What was the movie called? Oh my God... Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie? To the gym. Gaah! ...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure! Paaiint. Must paaiint. Everything clean. Paaiint. Must paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new! Ungh. Paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new. Paaiint. I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think Daddy's going out wrestling again. Paaiint.  Paaiint.  Must be made clean. New. Must clean Butters.  Clean. Never be clean. Must...  kill? The only way? Must kill Butters.  Paaiint. Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now. No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think. Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you? And sometimes moomies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best. If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert. I'm going to get out of the car now, Butters.  I want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened. Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy will be with you very soon. ""Dear bastard husband,"" No.  ""Dear lying sonofabitch,"" No.  ""Dear assface,"" Yeah, that's it. ""I will no longer-"" There you are, Jimmy! Hey, it's Gary! How are you? It's so nice to meet you. Ooo, the Rice Crispy squares are done! Great to meet you! What the?  Jimmy, oh my God! Shawna honey, I think your little date is here."

"GRANDPA","Shoot me. I wish I were dead. I'm not being silly! Kill me! I'd do it myself, but I'm too damn old! Aw Dammit!! How would you like to make a dollar, Billy? Dammit, Billy! Do you want a dollar or don't ya?! Okay, you just have to do one thing for me... WHY NOT?! I killed my grandpa when I was your age! What has America's youth come to?! Kids won't even kill their own grandparents!! Ingrate! You pompous son of a whore! Billy, help grandpa stick this fork in the outlet. Kill me God damnit! Well then have one of your little friends do it!! (To Cartman) You can kill me, can't you? Oh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky, your mom was over here earlier and I humped her like a little bitch. That's right. And then I dug up your great grandma's skeleton and had my way with her too! Choice piece of ass, your great grandma!! That's the spirit, Tubby!! (Calling after him) I ever tell you 'bout the time I boofed your dad, fatso? Billy, would you mind holding this for grandpa, please? (Choking) Tug... a... little... harder... Billy... (Coughing) Dammit, I was so close! Come here, Billy, I want to show you something... Yes you do you little pecker! I realized that the reason you won't kill me, is because you don't understand how I feel, Billy. But I found out a way to show YOU what it feels like to be grandpa. Now, you're about to see what it's like to be as old as me. Are you ready Billy? Not just yet. THAT'S IT!!!! NOW YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE GRANDPA!!!! So now will you kill me, Billy? That's good, Billy... A little higher now... Does the Pope crap in the woods? Cut the damn rope already! It's about time you late ass lazy son of a whore! Come on! Let's go! What the -- Come back here you pompass son of a panzy! I'm over here you son of a whore! HEY! You were supposed to kill ME!! That's not fair, God Dammit! My grandpa asked me to kill him and I did it! Grandpa? My name's not Billy, Grandpa! And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all haggard? Limbo? But I've been waiting for twenty- five years! Let nature run its course, or else end up in limbo... No, Billy, we're gonna watch the Bob Saget show. Ten thousand dollars!! Holy smokes!! I won! I won! Look at how big you've gotten! Well, this is what the holidays are about. Family. Well, what does your family do for the holidays, Stan? Well, it certainly is nice we could all gather heuh for the holidays. Even Uncle Howard has joined us live, via satellite, from the state penitentiary. No, Jimmy! This is my pot pie!  No, Jimmy! That's a bad Jimmy! Yes. Now, watch that ass in prison, son. Okay, you all know the rules. You must fire your blanks into the air, and if someone says they killed ya, you gotta play dead. It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to get the bell of Appmattox down from Tamarack Hill. What ensued was a bloody battle, but after many hours, the Union Army prevailed. Here now is the reenactment of that great battle. What the hell? The Confederacy doesn't take the bell! God damnit! Now we have to start over! Alright, folks. Sorry for the false start. We're ready to go again. It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to- God damnit, what the hell are they doing?! God damnit! Well, comem on Billy, we've gotta make these little peckers stop before they get themselves killed. They're not terrorists, they're just a bunch of drunk wankers from Colorado. You bastards! Nice thinkin', Billy. Damnit, Billy, this isn't about you havin' to be slaves! This is about history! We can't let them change it! Wait a munute! They're all still doing a reenactment. What we have to do is play into that. Come on, Billy. You boys need a quick history lesson! Why the hell do you wanna take these boys to see that fufu French theater crap? You're gonna turn them into poofders! Well, he doesn't need to see a bunch of frogs prance around in tights and make-op wrappin' their peckers around each other's faces! Close your eyes and cover your ears, Billy! Remember, you're a man. Aha, I knew it. They turned you into poofders. No, Billy! You're gonna stay here and watch more McGyver. We've gotta get all the Frenchy-poo fag-nasties out of ya.  Who the hell would be ringin' the doorbell at this time of night? That Grandma is not a bad piece of ass. Well, it's good for 'im. Got everything you need there, do ya? They're quite agile little things, aren't they? Y'don't say. You... ...remember any of that stuff, do ya? Ah.  Oh.  Ah!  Oh.  Oh-oooh-oooh! You're damn right she's tired. Oh, nothin'. She's just gonna have a little trouble walkin' today is all. . Well, all tuckered, is she? Ha ha ha ha. A little cottony in the crotch? Hr hr hr hr. What?!  Oh, dear Jesus! No wonder she didn't say good-night. What the hell's goin' on?! Aw, go ahead and shoot me! I dare ya! Pull the trigger, you little pussy! I wanna die."
"FATHER","Ha, ha! That's our silly grandpa! Me. Where is our daughter. Marcy! You're coming home this instant! You're not gonna make my daughter part of your cult! You're just a stupid little fat kid who thinks that-  Aaaah! She didn't want to, Kevin. She... had no choice."
"PHILLIP","Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart. Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too! I sure would Terrance. Take that you stupid dick! You're exactly right, Terrance!! What? Oh yeah! I love beans! Well, don't fart on me, Terrance! You're such an ASSHOLE Terrance!! Oh Terrance... What color is the wind? OH! YOU FARTED!! No, Terrance, why don't you tell me. Yes Terrance. I don't know Terrance, let me check... Hey Terrance, looks like this might be a good place to start a new colony. OH!! YOU STAINED MY PILGRIM HAT, BUTT PIPE! Yes, and hungry too. Being a Pilgrim totally sucks ass. Beans? Oh, oh, looks like we'll be at war with these Indians soon. Wait wait wait, here it comes... Oh, I crapped my pants. Oh, I think you got some spatter on Chief Running Wolf! Now he's a smelly Indian. Then I'm going to go with you, Terrance! Oh, Terrance, you've farted in court. Yes, please. The monkey claw is smelly! My sentiments exactly, your honor. I see from your accent that you're Southern-Canadian. Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is an innocent man. I have, haven't I, Terrance? Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is no more a murderer than you or me. He loves puppies and hates mean things. Would a murderer go to the zoo and feed animals like this? Of course not. So, in summation, find Terrance innocent... Or else he'll KILL you!! Ha, ha! Just kidding! The defense rests. Did you hear that, Terrance. You're not guilty! Oh, HA HA HA!!! Here, here! Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, right ol' pal? 'Cause you're a dick? Cancer? Yes, perhaps he's homophobic. We're not? Yes, It's been a long day. And only Kraft dinner can calm my nerves. He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next? The subway certainly is wonderful Terrance. Yes, let's look for treasure. Oh hello, ugly Bob. Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver. Wait, wait! I've got an idea! Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob? Hello, Barkie! Hello, Purry! Say, Terrance, I was just aboot to make some Kraft dinner. Would you like some? Oh Terrance! You got a letter! What is it, Terrance? Did you fart? Not Sally! Dear God, no, Terrance! Why Sally? God, why?! Say, Terrance... Who's Sally? I never knew you had a daughter, Terrance. No, you never did, Terrance. My God! What a fascinating story, Terrance! Especially the part aboot Celine Dion. Then I will go with you, Terrance. Well, you know what they say; 'A friend in need is a friend with Kraft Dinner'. Hello, Ugly Bob. (slamming the desk) Dammit, man! Danger or no, I'm going to help my friend find his daughter!!! Oh, good... Well, I certainly am going to miss Canada, Terrance. Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran... Please bring my body back to Canada and bury it in a box with a side of Kraft dinner. (singing) Oh Canada! Our home and native land! True patriot love in all thy sons command. Oh, good. Say, she looks a lot more like Celine Dion than you, Terrance. OH, NOW I SEE THE RESEMBLANCE!! Oh Raspberries, looks like I'm losing a friend. OH MY GOD, WHAT IS THIS?!?! Is this Canada? THIS IS MADNESS!!! I don't know, Terrance. And who is that smelly person in all these pictures? Why? Oh my God! It's Ugly Bob!! Because that's his name, you stupid bitch! Behold his horrible face!! Oh, the humanity!! Yes, I agree whole fartledly. Wait, what were you saying? What are you doing, Scott? Cancer? Hey! Don't give me cancer! Hey, Terrance let's watch American television! Oh look, here's a show -- God damn their TV shows are lame! Look at their silly American heads! Yes it is, Terrance. According to that newsy, he's some kind of Turkish dictator! That fart sounded just like a ringing phone Terrance. Tell him he's a smelly bastard. OHH!! That was Sir Smelley! He says hello!! Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure? No... We're searching for treasure. What do you mean? You mean WE are to blame?! What is it? For Canada, Terrance. Yes, this bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life. Wait a minute... Terrance that fart gives me pause... That smelly Saddam Hussein, he uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not? Terrance, get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can! I do Terrance (picking up the phone) Yes... Prepare the alert! Now, Terrance!! OH GLORIOUS DAY!! Don't touch me, ugly Bob. We came up with a better plan. You see Scott, after all your criticism it was farting that saved Canada! Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities? That's tomfoolery. Give it to me straight, Terrance. Oh, what a relief! Cancer?? My ass is collapsing? Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore? What's happening here, Terrance? Who's the donor? Terrance! You're giving up your ass for me? All right, Terrance. Well, all right. Okay. God. Oh, you got me, Terrance! That fart was absolutely ghoulish, Terrance. Aaaaagh! That's right, Terrance. This is the season for sharing. Waitwaitwaitwait. Hold on, hold on. Over here, over here. Okay, waitwait waitwait. Oh God, you're smelly! Terrance, what brand of pants am I wearing? How do you like that, Terrance? Hey, Terrance, I think I have to fart. Say Terrance, this body appears to have been moved since the murder. Look at the forensic evidence around the torso. Look closer.  Closer.  Hunh-nh. Waitwait. Hunh. Keep looking, Terrance. The forensic evidence is right around here.  Ah! Af! Excuse me, buddy. I'm looking for a mechanic. Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage? Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage without farting? No no no! I mean, could you tell me the directions again without you farting? Alright, no problem, buddy.  Now, tell me: How do I get to the auto garage to see a mechanic? Why the heck didn't you tell me you were the mechanic? ...after these messages. Ahhh Yes? Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there. AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac! Ah, I'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. It's old and stale! I mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long? Yeah, whatever, kid. What? Really? Well that sounds interesting. How much does it pay? I'm in! Here, call me at this number with the details.  Gotta run! Excuse me, is this where the Earth Day crap is happening?

I was just watchng this video, I ah-. You know, I've never seen it before. We sssure did go through a lot together. Terrance, I- That's what I was gonna say: You were an asshole, and this is mostly your fault.  But, you were always the more artistically driven of us; I ssshould've put more into it than I did. That's right, Terrance. You should only let trite things come between your asscheeks Here's a man's fart for ya. Oh no, hahahahahahaha. Oh, what is it? Killing is never an accident, you dickface! Hey Terrance, I think I have a- What?"

"REPORTER","Four third graders from South Park, Colorado were found trying to viciously murder an innocent, grandfather. Boys, how did you get driven so far to the edge? What changed you into such demonic little bastards? Terrance and Phillip!! Ah HA!!! SO it IS that show that is to blame! As the day progresses, more and more South Park residents continue to sling shot their bodies into the side of the Toon Central building. Toon Central is under incredible pressure to cancel the show, and has already lost over 20 percent of their sponsors... Hours have passed and still the die hard South Park parents are killing themselves in front of the Toon Central building one by one. Thanks, Tom. Already more than half of the townspeople here in South Park have been infected with the pink eye virus. Symptoms include a complete loss of heart functions, blood pressure, lung activity, and of course, sticky, puffy eyes. Satan, what do you expect the outcome of the fight to be? Officer Barbrady, what would drive a man to such a disgusting act? Do the police have any leads? Mayor! What do you plan to do about the South Park riots? But he's illiterate. What do you plan to do? As more and more cities are affected by the growing ash and the death toll rises to 3000,  people from all over the country are looking to the Mayor of South Park for answers.  Heh- And it appears as if the Mayor is going to explain matters now. And so, on this fifteenth day of what is considered to be the most important trial of the ü¾ ¼day, Johnny Cochran has appeared to defend Capitalist Records. The question now is, will Cochran use his famous ""Chewbacca"" defense? In a teary-eyed courtroom, Johnny Cochran has just finished his closing arguments, and, as was anticipated, he did use the Chewbacca defense  Whether or not it worked, is up to the jury to decide. Chef? How does it feel to be a free man and finally have your name credited on the song, ""Stinky Britches""? We interrupt this broadcast for a news bulletin. Mass murderer and extremely nasty person Charles Manson has escaped from prison! Manson was the man responsible for seven murders in the late '60's. Manson has never shown any signs of remorse for his crimes. If you see Manson, please kick his ass and smash his fucking face in for me, and then call the police. And now back to the game. A high speed car chase is happening right now on interstate 3. We go now to our live sky-fi helicopter. What about the prehistoric ice man? Dr. Mephesto, could you please tell us what's going on? Fascinating news tonight from South Park. An ancient discovery of a prehistoric man actually frozen in ice. A team of scientists continues to try and unfreeze the body so that it can be autopsied, and studied. The caveman was discovered by Kyle Broflovski, who had this to say: The prehistoric ice man is thought to be from the late neo-post-Jurrasic era, where he was probably part of a hunting and gathering tribe that lived on Waterston Street. As sexual harassment lawsuits increase all over the state, the mother of all trials is set to begin. The sexual harassment case of Everyone vs. Everyone begins tomorrow. No matter what the outcome, the public schools are sure to lose at least a whopping $30 million. Representing the side of Everyone is Gerald Broflovski, the lawyer from South Park who plans to make quite a commission. Representing the side of Everyone Else is Gerald Broflovski. So whatever the outcome, things look very bright for Kyle's dad. Personally, I think Kyle's dad is just a whore, taking advantage of everyone in town and...  This just in! Newscaster Kevin McCarty is being sued by Kyle's dad for slander. The newscaster has yet to be reached for comment. Wait... Tom, I'm standing in front of a house where a religious cult is planning to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts. Just moments ago, a couple emerged from the house.  According to the ATF, the couple refused to cooperate, then pulled out very big guns and started shooting everyone. The ATF had no choice but to shoot the insane couple, and now a standoff has ensued. The ATF commander tells us that he has reason to believe there may be children inside and that they are the primary concern of all. There are choppers here along with several tanks.  The commander is very concerned about what the mood is inside. We just received a photo from the recon team of the action inside the house showing eveidence that there are indeed innocent children trapped inside. Those sick cult fanatic bastards! I'm standing now with Danny Ganz, the commander of the ATF. Commander, what is the latest? So what are your plans, commander? Setting them on fire seems a little dangerous, commander. For hours now, the ATF has tried to communicate with the religious fanatics inside this house. The meteor shower is expected to begin at any moment, and so time is running out. Excuse me, but what proof do you have that those people inside are religious fanatics? Uh yes, but you totally screwed up Waco. You killed a bunch of innocent people and then tried to say they killed themselves. Yes. Huh? Hold on just a minute! This is Derek Smalls reporting. We have just received an exclusive video from inside the house , proving that the people inside are not cultists after all. And now, for a special annoucement from the President of the United States. ...And she was forced to live off her own feces for several days. In national news,  a frightening radical group from Colorado is making its way across the Southern states of Aemrica.  The group is recruiting new members in every town they pass through, and rapidly growing in number.  So authorities have decided to call in the National Guard. The groups seems to be led by military mastermind and right-wing radical Jimbo Kern , who is known for his guerilla-fighting and leadership skills. Tomorrow the whole world will be tuning in as over 4 million children play ""My Coutnry 'Tis Of Thee"" on their recorders. It is by far the largest gathering of little plastic recorders in human history. Yoko Ono has... Words to live by. Tom, I'm standing in New York City, but it could just as well be any town on Earth right now. The desolation, the damage is exactly the same in every city the whole world over. It's been just under 20 hours since everyone on Earth pooped their pants, and people still roam their damaged homes with disbelief, and loss. Rick? Tom, I'm standing at the home in South Park where five precious little girls have been rescued from Romania. Their mother passes away some months ago, and then their grandmother died trying to bring them here. But all is well now, and people are coming from all over the country to view the little tykes.  If you'd like to come down and visit the quintuplets, admission is only $5, and for a few dollars more , you can feed them fishsticks. Tom, it looks like these cute little girls have made it out of that armpit of a country they call Romania. Yes, luckily for them, these quintuplets no longer have to live in Romania, the asshole of the world.  Back to you, Tom. Tom, it is now Easter morning, and as the U.S. government promised, they are here to take the girls back to their father in Romania. Rumor has it that Janet Reno herself will be extraditing the quintuplets. Tom, I'm standing out front of the South Park Mayor's Office, where both sides of this debate have gathered. Earlier, the South Park townspeople voiced their opinion. Well, one things for sure, tensions are high and pressure is mounting on the South Park Mayor to do something. What's this? Uh, Tom, it looks as if the KKK have shown up to espress their opinion. Should the Klan be allowed to rally on the steps of the Capitol? Here's what some people think. On Friday, South Park Elementary will present its debate, and after the debate, there will finally be a vote. Preliminary polls show three in favor of changing the flag, three against changing the flag, and 4382 undecided. So the pressure in on those South Park kids! Tom, I'm standing out in front of Henry's Supermarket where five brave little boys are holding a rally to support gays in scouting. The rally is drawing so much attention that people all over the country are taking media notice. The rally has also caught the attention of high-powered lawyer, Gloria Allred. With this kind of support, Tom, these boys are sure to have a victory for gays. Back to you. Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where Earth Day 2001 is in full force. Environmental awareness games, boths, and of course,  the entertainment on stage, which is being broadcast live all over the country. This eco-happy crowd is thrilled and waiting in anticipation for the arrival of Terrance and Phillip, who are promised by these four boys. Another high-alert status for terrorists activity this weekend.  The government said ""bad things are likely to happen."" Meanwhile, the world continues to back down from their support of the United States  saying that they were really only kidding to begin with. Ms. Hamilton was the fourth person to be run over by a motorcycle this week, leaving a city to ponder, who will be next? A billion billionaires are gathering their ranks and will be marchng on the town square tonight  in South Park to petition the end of separate bars, bus seating and restaurants. It looks like it will be a great turnout, as some of the millionaires also paid several thousand Mexicans to march for them. Tom, I'm standing out in front of the Mayor's office, where the big liar, Jared, is once again about to speak. Apparently, Jared hopes to regain his celebrity hero status, which was lost when he announced that it was AIDS, not sub sandwiches, that caused him to lose weight. Let's listen in. Tom, I'm standing in the town square where just moments ago it was declared that AIDS... can finally be joked about. What a great day for humanity Tom, I'm standing out front of the Stem Cell Research Facility with terrific news. Christopher Reeve, who was once paralyzed, claims that he can now stand. Tom, many celebrities have spoken out in protest of stem-cell research, but, after seeing this, how can they protest now? Tom, several years ago, actor Christopher Reeve had a horrible accident and was paralyzed. The irony, of course, is that the man who played Superman could no longer walk. America watched in wonder as he managed to move one of his fingers, then his arms. And now, seen for the first time on HBC, Christopher Reeve is going to lift a truck up over his head. Tom, the irony is even more irony-y as it appears that the stem cells have given Christopher Reeve almost superhuman strength. Uh Tom, apparently, Gene Hackman, the man who played Superman's enemy Lex Luthor in the movies, has now shown up as a celebrity protester of stem-cell research. If that isn't ironic, Tom, I don't knw what is. Tom, if irony were made of strawberries, we'd all be drinking a lot of smoothies right now. Tom, over five years ago, doctors told Christopher Reeve that he would never walk again, but the resilient actor fought back, struggled against all odds, and has now built his very own Legion of Doom!  The once immobile Mr. Reeve's new organization will be commited to world domination and evil. What an inspirational story, Tom. And sources say that the new film will star Ben Affleck. Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the first Metrosexual Pride Parade is underway! Tom, I'm standing in a meadow just outside of town where police have discovered the first victim of the serial copycat killer. Child wunderkind Eric Cartman is now arriving on the scene. Tom, the crowd just keeps getting bigger and the town is literally bursting at the seams. We don't know where this music festival came from, but, it's very close to consuming us all. Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where a desparate attempt to save the town is underway. Some call it a suicide mission, but the heroic men and women of the hippie digger may be our only hope of survival. Tom, I'm standing here with the little sluggers and some of their parents, and I can;t tell you how excited they are. Little Stan Marsh is the pitcher for the South Park Little League team, and Stan, how does it feel to be playing for the State Championship? Mr. Marsh, you must be very proud of your son."

Oh I'm so hungry and all I can think about eating is is... BRAINS! It should be something festive! Well, Mayor. Its based on the cash grab. But instead of money, the cans of food are blown around inside the capsule. The pov catches as many as he can to feed his family. POVerty stricken citizen. I don't know, Mayor. (looking at a program) I don't think it's listed on the program. Oh that's T.V.'s Eric Roberts, we were able to get him to play the part of the little monkey guy. Reading classes. Plain and simple. By the Mayor's order, Officer Barbrady is on a temporary leave of absence to learn to read. Effective immediately. This time he made love to Carla Weathers prize chicken. She's catatonic Uh, just dramatic effect, sorry. From this day on, all will be well. Yes, your two hundred American dollars will last months here. We... could use the debate as an excuse to hold a vote on the issue. Spitball! In South Park. Peace. Mark, we have to be willing to supply condoms to anyone who requests them. Would you rather them do it unprotected? Kids are going to do what they do, and it's up to us to make sure they're protected. Sure we do. We just got in the new Gladiators for kids. 'Lil Mini's. They're specially designed for kids under 10, and they're only five ninety five for a box of fifty. No, you have to change it. Somebody threw a ninja star in that poor puppy's eye?"
"DOCTOR","Very interesting... Well, your temperature is only 55 degrees, you have no pulse, no heartbeat, and your eyes are all puffy and sticky. Yea, I'm afraid the two of you have pink eye. I'd give you topical medicine but I don't want to touch you. Yeah, well, for God's sake don't touch your eyes. I'll prescribe some antibiotics. Why hello Chef. Let me guess -- pink eye, right? What the hell are you talking about? Chef, I think maybe the pink eye has made you a little delirious. Let me give you some topical cream -- Uh Mr. Torres was here for a routine checkup, Chef. Hey... Hey now, there have been a lot of incredible advances in topical creams over the last few years! Well, it was the Mortician and his assistant at the Morgue yea. Now now, fellas, let's form a line. I've got enough topical cream for everybody! One moment please! NURSE! I need twenty CCs of sodium pentothal, STAT!! We're an equal opportunity employer here, son. I'll be with you right after I inject this man with a long needle. There, there, young man. Medical science is nothing to be afraid of. Yeah, I can hear the needle scraping against the bone inside! Oop, he's hemorrhaging! Oop! His head fell off! Well, some people just have a weak stomach. Well, this is about all I can do for him. Sorry, son, it might be a while. (Pulling him off) Now, son, that's not gonna do him any good. I'll let you know if there's a change in his condition. My God, that's a hell of a storm. We're doing the best we can, ma'am. They've closed the pass and none of the other doctors can get through. For now it's just me and Nurse Goodly. Yes. I'm afraid we're critically understaffed. Unless we get help soon, all these people in here are completely fucked. (To them) Metaphorically speaking, that is. He's on full life support and breathing fine. He shouldn't need any help... So long as the power doesn't go out. Whoof, who didn't see that coming a mile away, huh? Nurse! I could use some help in here! Nurse, PLEASE! I need another pair of HANDS in here!! (Beat) Oh... Sorry. Please, Mr. Chef, I have over a hundred people to tend to here, and only myself and Nurse Goodly. Do you know anything about surgery? WHAT?! Why the hell didn't you say so! Put on some scrubs!! Boys, I'm making you all honorary doctors! You can help us save these people's lives! This man's appendix has burst. I have no choice but to operate now, with our limited power. I need you all to be strong for me. Okay. Nurse Goodly will take care of anaesthesia. Chef, you'll act as her arms. Boys, you have to help with suction and bandages. Ready? Okay, first I'll make an incision on the chest over the heart. (Jumping up and down) Suction! I found a map that shows the location of a backup generator! Apparently they built a large, self- sustaining generator for just this kind of emergency. But it's out and away from the hospital! We must split up into two teams. Team A and Team B. Team A will consist of myself, Stan, Kyle, Eric, Chef, and Nurse Goodly. Team B will consist of Kenny. (To Kenny) Now listen closely, team B. Your goal will be turn on the backup generator. To do this, you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct. Meanwhile, team A will go to the holding area... HERE. Where there is a television and some cocoa. We will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until Team B makes it through the sewage duct. By that time, team B (remember, that's you Kenny) should reach the outer core of the generator. It will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top, and there could be velociraptors HERE. Once you reach the top, you should be able to get a clear view through THIS window, of us drinking cocoa and watching television. Then you can proceed down into the generator and power it on. Are there any questions? Right then, let's DO IT!! GO TEAM!!! Team B... Come in, Team B. Listen, Team B, we've found another path to the generator. There's actually a nice, heated walkway to it, so you don't need to walk through all that sewage. Oh... Well forget I said that then. Listen, team B, you should be seeing a large drift of snow with some metal sticking out of it just to your left... Good heads towards it, Team A out. Roger Team B. He's reached the backup generator. Team B can you see the two copper nodes? Good, now is there a wire connecting them? Damn. The wire connecting the nodes is gone. We need to complete the circuit between them or we're screwed. There's no time. Once these lights flicker out. All the patients on life support are going to die. No Kenny you can't. There must be some other way. He's going to make the connection himself with his hands. Kenny... Nooooooo...... Quickly, get the scanner running again!! We've got a chance, now!! Well, we made it. The power is on, the snow is melting and your friend Mephesto is doing fine. Where is the little fat boy? He'll be delighted that Mephesto is awake. Oh, my pleasure, Sheila. I brought the normal cutting device, but then I remembered that Ike was Canadian, so I brought the right one . Where is the little rug rat? Come 'ere, you! Ike? Ike? There you are. Come on Ike, it's time. Bu-bu-but son I just- Kyle. A-a circumcision is a very common thing for Ike to have. His father had it, his grandfather had it. And  his brother had it. We're not going to cut it off! We're just goin' to snip it, so it looks bigger. And-a one and-a two and-aü¾ ¼ bris . You're a very lucky little boy. I've never seen a hemorrhoid so infected. It could have killed you. I don't understand it. He's not fighting the infected hemorrhoid at all. It's like he... like he's lost all hope. Well if you'll excuse me, I've got more tests to run. I'm sorry. Your son appears to be losing the battle. I'm afraid that the hemorrhoid has spread to his lungs. Normally, the body would fight the infection, but he's... he's just... given up on life. There's nothing I can do. Little fella's just... lost his will to live. Well, I sssuppsed it could be rigged, but I- He's coming back. Wait a minute. Yes! The hemorrhoid is Alright, Ms. Sanders, all ready for your abortion? Well, try to relax; It will all be over very soon. Oh yes, I 'm sorry. Have you heard of stem-cell research? Well basically, a lot of amazing studies have shown that stem cells might be used to fight cancer and a myriad of other diseases. Right now, a lot of stem cells come from the tissue of aborted fetuses-  ah I'm sorry, unwanted children. And if you sign a release, that tissue can go to studies The hope is that someday it might. Great.  Well, here we go. Nurse?  This is to go to Alder's Labs for stem-cell research. There we go, little buddy. You sure you don't wanna take your jacket off; it's pretty warm. Hmm, what a lucky little man. We'll be right outside if you need us, Kenny. Well, he's a very sick little tugboat. He's going to live, but- Sorry. ...Now? Oh. Uh, your tugboat's going to be okay. He just needs an oil change and a new steamstack. Well of course you are! And Canada Friends welcomes you! That's Scott! He's a dick! Oh no you don't, Scott! Leave these boys alone! The new Prime Minister doesn't live in this part of Canada. He's in Ottawa. Good-bye, friends! Good luck with the new Prime Minister! And remember to watch out for Scott! He's a dick! Excuse me, what are you doing here?! If you wanna be in the OR, a pass is required! Well, you're in luck, I'm happy to inform! ...an abortion? Mmister Garrison- Mmrs. Garrison, you can't have an abortion. No, I mean you're physically unable to have an abortion, because you can't get pergnant. You can't have periods either.  You had a sex change, Mr. Garrison, but you don't have ovaries or a womb. You don't produce eggs. N-that's right. Basically, yes. Your son is suffering from severe dementia. He claims that the ghost of a dead friend talks to him. This is usually a sign of schizophrenia brought on by some tragic event in the child's past. I think it's best that we take him to the mental center and do some tests. All right, Butters, just try to relax. Doin' just fine, Butters.  Just stay perfectly still now, Butters. Good. You're gonna feel a little pinch now, Butters.  Don't worry, Mr. Stotch. Whatever traumatized yoru son in his past, we'll find it. Well, after fourteen hours of testing, I can say Butters is definitely suffering from aggravated repressied memory syndrome. You see, Butters, when the brain wants to cover something up, it makes up images and sounds for you to hear. Good. We're making a lot of headway. We'll do some more testing tomorrow. All right, folks. Let's let Butters get some rest."

You're supposed to just send money. And once in a while they write you a letter. You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like South Park. Because he can't! Because 8 year olds can't be parents. I can't. I'm, ah, very busy. I send my $5 a month. See? Children, I have some difficult news for you... Mr. Garrison won't be teaching for a while. He has to have surgery. So you're going to have a substitute teacher. And I want you to show the substitute the SAME respect you show for Mr. Garrison... Yes, little boy? Oh.

Well, Ms. Makarakesh, you certainly tried to put one over on US, boy howdy!! Take her away! I am very disappointed in you, young man. You should be ashamed of yourself. What could have possessed you to be so stupid? We-hell, 'sorry' isn't going to cut the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you from school. Well, I guess that's a grown-up way to put it, yes. It was an error of judgment, Mr. Mackey, but I'm afraid I have to let you go for it. We searched each one of those kids, but came up empty. We had to let them go home, and one of them now has half a lid of Jamaican grass because of you! There, there, now. Maybe this will all blow over some day and we can give you a job as a janitor cleaning up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff. We were wrong for shunning you, Mr. Mackey, and we apologize. We should have realized that you needed help. You're gonna thank us later. Wwell, Mrs. Broflovski, it certainly is a thrill seeing your cheery face again. What seems to be pissing you off today? Yah-of course you do! Oh. And uh what disease is that? What's that? She does? No-o, I never did. Did you say a fetus, sticking out from her head? Well, I'll talk to Nurse Gollum, but I'm sure she'll be delighted. Let's say around 8? Now, you did say she has a fetus on her head? Oh. Ehsooo, I-ee hear that the South Park Cows are playing for the State Finals in dodgeball tonight. So did you ever think of just, you know, having it cut off? Ooohh, so I suppose that's out. Uhow about a hat, then? Oooohh, yeess, a Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week. You know, that has a nice ring- Oh, my. What an ungrateful bitch. Well, whatever happened to him happened at the planetarium. I think tonight the planetarium is doing laser Loggins. I might have to check it out. Oh, man, this is boring! Well, not any more than any other student. I don't know! I can't be around every second! All right, all right, I killed him. I hit him over the head and I cut up the body. I tried to burn him, but it wouldn't burn! Oh, the smell of it! I put the legs in garbage bags and hid the torso under a bridge. I HAD TO DO IT!!  OH GOD!!! I believe so, yes. Oh, dear God! We're ruined! Ogh! Attention, students. Don't forget that this Friday night is the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. We will have a very special band performing, so please come early. Boys and girls, can I have your attention, please? This year we have a very special guest performing the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. He was a musical force in the '70's and '80's. Please welcome Ronnie James Dio! Well, Timmy. I just don't know what to do with you. You're getting very poor marks in school and the teachers are complaining that you aren't paying attention. Well, that does it! I'm suspending you, Timmy, until you can learn to respect your elders! What?? Oh! Well, that certainly would explain it. Good. What can we do for him, doctor? Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa- Thursday's no good, we've got chior council. What about next Sunday? Oh, I can't do Monday. Yeah. How about Saturday at 11:30? You see that, parents. Your children have refused to come into class since this morning. I'm afraid your son is the leader, Ms. Cartman.  Apparently he's read the entire Bible, and now he's scaring the hell out of everyone. Don't listen to them, kids. You have to go to school. Oh, this new fourth-grade teacher is driving me nuts! Well, Ms.... Choksondik, those children did fairly well in the third grade. Oh? Which one? I'm afraid that's impossible. Nobody's seen Mr. Garrison since the last school year ended. Wuh sure thing, fine, bye-bye then. Whattaya think? Too forward? Waaah! As we said before, that's impossible. And then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy. He finaly snapped and had a nervous breakdown and... went up into the mountains to live in solitude. But he could be anywhere up high in those mountains. Mr. Garrison? You admit it? You admit it! Yeah, I swore that if I had to see it one more time, I'd put a bullet in my head.  But luckily I got really stoned before I came. Oh, oh, haha. Wow. Oh, wow. Oh. Oh, wow! WOWuh! Ah, Ms. Choksondik, can we have a quick word with you? And so apparently there's been a little mixup. The manatees were meant to go to the Denver Shelter Aquarium and the frogs were meant to come here. Congratulations. How do you feel? Oh, looks like the weather might turn shitty. Okay, parents. I know a lot of you want a chance to speak, but we have to talk one at a time. School policy has been to teach sexual education later. In the fifth grade. Teachers, I have some bad news. Last night I received a phone call from the local pharmacist. Apparently, almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active. And now that we've scared them a little they're buying condoms to use. But how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use? I guess we have no choice. Then it's decided: no more condom classes in grade school. Hello, boys. Yes, Mr. Garrison. Have a seat.  Mr. Garrison, sometime ago you asked to be promoted from teachng kindergarten back to the third grade. I wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences. It was wrong of us, and I want to make it up to you. As you know, the position of Fourth Grade teacher has become available, and we'd like to offer YOU the job. We in administration see now that you are an individual with your own preferences, and we respect that. I know you will. It's for real, Mr. Garrison. With all the new laws we could never fire you for being gay now. You'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars. Well, I was just saying that the policies have really changed. You know, we fire you for acting gay next time, you'd be able to sue the school district for ...lots of money. Oh. Well, there was the case out in Minnesota where the guy was awarded... 25 million, I think. Mr. Garrison to the principal's office, please? Oh yes, uh, Mr. Garrison, have a seat Mr. Garrison, Chef has brought it to my attention that some uh students are a bit... uuuncomfortable about certain aspects of your teaching meathods. Nonono we're not firing you. No, we're sending Chef to a tolerance seminar. You demostrate a lack of tolerance for Mr. Garrison's behavior. In fact, I believe you used the words ""sick queer"" to describe his conduct in class? I just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to Mr. Garrison before I send you away, Chef. No, no, I think I have a better idea. I'm sorry Mr. Garrison, but it's obvious you aren't tolerant of your own behavior. All right. Will you people stop barging into my office, please? Get him out of here! Luckily for us, one of you had enough of a conscience to come forward. Okay, thank you, Kyle Broflovski. All right, students, members of the school board. Our last speaker will discuss the important role of Latinos in the arts. Here is... Eric Cartman. Eric Cartman? Oh, Jesus Christ. Is it true? Jennifer Lopez is here? J-Lo, can we get a picture of you with the kids? Filthy bastard Native American money! Well, you boys have certainly done it this time! Not as sorry as you're going to be when your parents get here! Ah, here they come now. Come on in. You'd better brace yourself, parents. The boys were caught... smoking! We've simply had it with your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Voting just doesn't appear to be important to 'im. Well, my hands are tied. We can no longer have Stan's behavior jeopardizing the other children. He must be removed. Nno, I'm afraid it's worse than that. By county law I'm bound to enforce the harshest punishment possible. No. Banishment. You can appeal to the city council, but I don't think it'll do any good. Your son must leave South Park, never to return. Oh my goodness! Well I... we... Fine. Mr. Garrison, for the love of God. Mr. Mackey, it's over."

In other news, a pink eye epidemic is now sweeping the town of South Park. Here with a live report is a midget wearing a bikini. In local news, a stomach virus is going around that is causing bleeding of the colon in some small children. Doctors are telling parents that the virus is nothing to worry about and that the infections can be dealt with with simple antibiotics.  Well, it's just four days until New Year's Eve, 1999. The new millennium is almost upon us, and all over the world people have started to celebrate by dancing, singing, and killing one another.  But probably the biggest event of the millennium is one happening in South Park, Colorado, where people have gathered for a chance to see Jesus Christ. Craig Netzel is standing by. Thousands of people have descended on South Park for a hippie music jam festival. The event is said to be the largest such gathering in the history of man. Fear and horror in South Park today as the music festival continues to grow. They're arriving in droves and apparently no end is in sight."

Perhaps if more of you attended church on Sundays , the Lord would not have felt it necessary to punish us by takething this little boy... Let's go Broncos Let's go Broncos Boys, I haven't seen you in church lately. You're not too Jewish to worship Jesus, are you? Good. Boys, how would you like to perform the Stations of the Cross this Friday night? It's like a skit, where you reeanct the death and glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ. Huh? Wonderful. Here's a book on how to perform it. Don't let me down, boys. Well, well, well. A lot of you came to church. Looks like we're a little ""nervous"" about this spontaneous combustion thing, huh? Well, on this blessed Friday let us give thanks for stuff, and things. Lord, is it so much to ask that you not let us suddenly burst into flame for no apparent reason? I mean, come on! Amen.  And now, some of our darling local children are going to perform the Stations of the Cross. Thank you, boys. Blessed be the name of Jesus! Do you, Chef, take this woman as your lawful-wedded wife, to have and to- And do you, Veronica, take Chef to be your daddy? And now a special sharing of vows through song. BOYS! You are in CHURCH! Thank you, Mr. Mackey. Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to talk about hell. Hell is not a very nice place. Burning, searing, flames. Screaming, torture. For eternity. Once you are in hell, you cannot escape. You live forever in horrible pain, in burning agony. All sinners are there in misery, dying over and over and over.  If you be cast down into this black bog of stench, then woe is thou,  for Satan has made it the most miserable place in the universe! And he will be your ruler!  Your rulet of pain and agony! A place of everlasting agony and pain! Hell awaits all sinners and all who do not accept Christ!  Children in this town have not been attending Sunday school after Mass! And adults have not been coming to Confession! If this does not change, I promise you, you will be going to the black pit of Satan's world!  That is all. Peace be with you. Hell is a very real place, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. I'm trying to save their souls and the souls of everyone in this town from the wretched lake of fire! Blessed art thou, child. Now, what do you have to confess? Your  con- confession does not leave this box. Oh. Well, Uh arr-I'm sure he would forgive you if he knew. I... see. Okayokay, fine! Well, has your friend ever confessed or been baptized? Then, hell awaits him. They SHOULD be worried! Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends! Oh. You're the little Jewish boy, right? Well, young man, you can rest assured that according to Matthew 25, when you die you will stand before God and he will will say, ""Depart from me, you cursü¾¼d, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."" Yes! As a Jew, your home will be the lake of fire. I hope to see all of you in church this Sunday. Sister, the Jews crucified our Savior. I mean, if you don't go to hell for crucifying the Savior, then what the hell do you go to hell for?! Whoa!  Son of a bitch! Uhuh. Kids, uh. Oh! Huh huh. Huh huh.  Oh, forgive me, heavenly Father! I've sinned against you! M-Mrs. Donovan is a temptress from hell! Today, we're going to talk about hell. Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends! People, people, please! You're forgetting that homosexuality is a choice! As many of you know, I, myself, went through a... homosexual... phase. But the light of Christ showed me how to change. Just give me two hours with this man, and I can convert him back. Eric, God could sure use that money for a bigger church. Uh... Good-bye, everyone. Fathers, I want to thank you all for coming. Uh-yes, uh, I'm afraid if things keep going the way they are, we could lose our entire religion. Right, and so... wa- wait a minute. What? Whoa, whoa, hold on a second! The problem is that children are being molested, not that they're reporting it! Well, I mean, obviously, what we need to put a stop to is all the sexual misconduct that is allowed to take place in our churches, and not just tell the children not to tell anybody about it. I mean, right? No. No, I mean! I've never molested any of the children in my church! Oh for the love of God! Are you all saying that you've engaged in inappropriate relations with your altar boys? We are here to bring the light of God, not harm the innocent!  I'm serious! Dear God. This problem is much more severe than I could have possibly imagined. I have to go to the Vatican and get help. Well, there you go. Um, grazie.  Wow, I'm actually here. Vatican City! Gelgameks? Look, people! I'm just trying to say that if we don't change the Holy Document of Vatican Law, then we might lose everyone to atheism! Well, for one, no sex with boys. Uh well then, perhaps we could change the Holy Document of Vatican Law to say that... it's okay for a priest or bishop or cardinal to have sex... with women. Wuh- okay, m-maybe we just need to forget about the Gelgameks for a second and focus- I'm just saying, what works on planet Gelgamek isn't necessarily goin' ta work for the rest of us here, on Earth. You see? That's the problem we're having here. Why not?! But if we locate it we can make changes to it? Well we have to try. Our religion is dying! Ahh, hello. Uh- My name is Father Maxi, from the United States. I... I'm trying to find the Holy Document of Vatican Law. ...So that we can make revisions to it. I have to try. Our religion is in trouble, and... and that scroll may be our only hope! Very well. Here we go.  Hmmm, there's a ladder up here.  Oh my God, a rattlesnake! A way back up!  I've made it! Praise be to God! He hath shown me the way! This must be it. The Holy Document of Vatican Law. Yes, I have returned with the Holy Document of Vatican Law, so can we PLEASE, change it now to say, ""It's NOT okay to have sex with boys""? Oh my. Queen spider? Alright, that does it!!! I've had enough!!! You people have completely lost touch with the outside world! You sit in this big room with your Gelgameks and your Queen Spider, and none of it applies to what being a Catholic is all about!! To hell with the Holy Document of Vatican Law!! No I didn't! All that's dead are your stupid laws and rules!  You've forgotten what being a Catholic is all about. This... book. You see, these are just stories.  Stories that are meant to help people in the right direction. Love your neighbor. Be a good person. That's it! And when you start turning the stories into literal translations of hierarchies and power, well... Well, you end up with this.  People are losing faith because they don't see how what you've turned the religion into applies to them! They've lost touch with any idea of any kind of religion, and when they have no mythology to try and live their lives by, well, they just start spewing a bunch of crap out of their mouths! Look, I, I'm proud to be a Catholic. But I'm a Catholic in the real world. In today's world! It's time for you all to do that, too. It is time... for change."

I'm just gonna have to not see Saddam. Put him out of my mind and focus on Chris. If I don't see Saddam, then I won't have such strong feelings for him. Thanks guys. Oh hi, Chris! What? You WHAT?!

I love you too, Saddam. If I go spend the night with Saddam, then it's over between me and Chris. Chris has been so nice to me and I know Saddam will just hurt me again. M-maybe I'll just go talk to Saddam. I need closure, yeah. That's it, I need closure.  What am I doing?? Saddam, I'm just here to talk. Saddam, I only came here because I need closure. No! Saddam, listen to me. Um maybe just- a little one.  I have to go back soon. I need you to understand that we can't be together anymore. I need you to not come by the condo and not try to see me. Chris thinks we can all be friends, but I don't. And I have to focus on Chris now.  What is this? Saddam, will you listen to me?! Chris is a great person. He's the one I wanna be with now. Saddam... Ooh, whoa. God, my head. Drank too much.  Chris!  Oh no!! Oh God, what time is it?! I don't know. I, I guess so, but now I have to go home and tell Chris. No, Saddam!

Yeah, I just... spent the night walking around the marina. Yes. What? Oh, n-NO! I know. Well-, could you not be such a pussy about it? I mean, can't you just say ""If you ever see Saddam again, I'll break your legs!"" or, or ""I'm gonna go kick Saddam's ass!"" or something?

You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, and for some reason, I just can't accept that. Chris!  Saddam, what the hell are you doing?! No! Not like this! Oooyeah! Now you are all part of my domain! Everyday in hell grows larger as my minions... my m-minions uh...  muh, I'm sorry. I just can't do this today. I'm just... I'm sorry. Chris!  But I thought you were dead! Chris, I didn't mean for Saddam to stab you in- Uh, ...yeah. Gr-great. And now it's like there's one guy who's horrible to me but I'm totally sexually attracted to, and then one guy who's really nice to me but I'm not sexually attracted to at all.

Ah, look, I just need to talk with God. Is he around? Great. Thanks. Ah. Hello? g-God? It's uh... Satan. Hi, God. Yeah. No, I hae a problem, and I- need your advice. No, it's kind of a long story but, well, it all started when this Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein , was killed by a pack of wild boars. I remember when I first met him in hell. It was a lovely morning in April... Heh-and now Chris and Saddam just keep killing each other over and over and... I don't know which one to pick. Huh? Well, I just don't know which one to pick. God, you're right. You know, I've had steady relationships for the last... thousand years, and when one ends I just start another one, but... I haven't taken the time to be secure with myself. Hey- Thanks, God. I forgot how clear you make things sometimes. You too. Uh, no, I need to be getting back. Wow. That sounds great, but uh, I really- gotta go. Guys, guys, guys!  Look, you both can stop fighting now! I've made a decision. Yes. I... don't want to be with either one of you. Saddam, you're an asshole. And you'll never be the friend that I want. And Chris, well, you're a pussy. And you'll never be the lover I want.  So I'm just gonna be alone for a while and learn to like myself. No, I'm not going on a walk!

Be passive, Okay? that's what I taught the little British boy, Pip, and just look at how much the other children like him now! Now, Kyle as your school counselor, I want to try and help you confront your problem, okay. Well it's MY understanding that you... (checking his notes) ...You have an acute case of fecalphelia. Well, a fecalpheliac is somebody who is obsessed with mookie-stinks, Kyle. Now, I also understand that you're Jewish, is that right Kyle? So, this must be a pretty hard time of year for you... Being Christmas and all. Do the other kids make fun of you? And that must make you mad. Mad enough to KILL, Kyle? Oh, that's good.

My name is Ms. Gorache and I need to ask you a few questions about your priest, okaaay? Okay. Would you say that Father Maxi is... nice? Or mean? Okaaay, what words would you use to describe your priest? Okay. And did Father Maxi, at any time, ever try to put somethig in your butt? You don't need to be ashamed or embarassed.

You don't care about Terrance and Phillip. Nothing matters more than saving the planet from Republicans.  You don't need to see Terrance and Phillip. Their will is strong. Very well, kids, we'll work on getting the event ready here, and you go get Terrance and Phillip. But I warn you: You'd better not promise things to Earth Day people that you can't deliver. Earth Day people can be... eheheh very unforgiving. Work! Work, children! We only have two more days until Earth Day! Work! That's not true.  Global warming is going to kill us all.  The Republicans are responsible. Oh, there you are, boys. I need Terrance and Phillip's information so I can tell them their schedule. Youuu what? You promised us Terrance and Phillip! We therefore promised the WORLD Terrance and Phillip! You WILL get us Terrance and Phillip, or else! Then you'd better get your asses to Canada and GET him. We'll make travel arrangements.  Nothing is more important than the environment, boys. Not even your lives. Work faster! Faster, children! Earth Day is coming!  Well, boys, it's rehearsal time, and your Terrance and Phillip haven't shown up. Maybe you kids don't understand how important Earth Day is for the future of our planet.

Well shucks, if I weren't real, could I sing this jolly Christmas song? (Singing) Santa Claus is on his way He loaded goodies on his sleigh He'll drop 'em off on Christmas Day And I'll say HOWDY HO!! (Singing) Folks'll gather round the fire Sing a song form a choir Pretty soon they'll all retire And I'll say HOWDY HO!! I hope that Santa comes real soon been waiting since the first of June -- HOWDY HO!! You should be wearing socks to sleep, Kyle. You're gonna catch a cold. Ooh, gee that's too bad... Say, that sounds like a swell idea! We can show everyone the true spirit of Christmas! Howdy ho! Golly, that isn't very nice! I'd sure like to teach him a lesson! Aah! Kyle, Howdy Ho! Santa's loaded up his sleigh Soon he'll be on his merry way... HOWDY HO!!! HOWDY FOLKS! Gosh you sure do smell nice and flowery! Howdy Ho, Chef! What's all the ruckus? I reckon this could be a job for Mr. Hankey! STOP FIGHTING!!! Come on, gang, don't fight! You people have focused so hard on the things wrong with Christmas, that you've forgotten what's so right about it! Don't you see? This is the one time of year we're supposed to forget all the bad stuff. Stop being sad about the state of world... And for just one day, say 'Oh to heck with it! Let's sing and dance and bake cookies!' HOWDY HO, KYLE!!! I brought some friends with me! Well, I've got a LONG night ahead of me!! BYE, BYE! AND MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! Ky-yle! Ky-yle! Hooowwwdy ho! Ky-yle! Ky-yle! Hooowwwdy ho! Howdy-ho, boys. Gosh, look at yuh. You're all growin' up sho fasht. Have you all been brushing behind your teeth? And usin' dental floss? And washin' behind your ears? Oh, I just got a little cold is all. All these new people in South Park are stressful unto my home. Well, you see, boys, the sewer is a fragile ecosystem. These new folks in town eat nothin' but cous cous, tofu, and raw vegetables, and it's destroying my environment. That's why, Kyle. That's why. There's only one time of year I can come to the surface, and that's Christmastime. That's why I need you boys to go for me. Don't forget to change your sheets once a week! Oh, Kyle. Howdy-ho.  Well, how did it go? Is everyone gonna stop poopin' in my environment? Oh. I, I see. Welluh shucks, Kyle, I can't thank you enough for tryin' Aw I can't. The sun'll dry me out. But I won't last long up above. All right, just let me get my toothbrush. No, I'm not leaving without you.  We started this together, we're gonna finish it together. It sure is -dry up here. Kyle. Be-fore I go there's something I must tell you. Come clo-ser.  Clo-ser. There is a-nother Sky-walk-er. Wake up. Come clo-ser. Clo-ser. Closer!  One time, when you were sleeping, I put myself in your mouth and had my friend take a picture. Kyle. Howdy-ho. That was delicious. Hoooooowwwdy-ho! Howdy-ho, folks. I'm afraid my buddy Kyle was right. There's not enough room in South Park to accomodate a festival. Uh, folks, please. Little towns like this simply aren't made for friggin' films. We love havin' visitors, but golly, too many of you is hurtin' our ecosystem. Be-sides, folks, film festivals shouldn't be about what celebritites are comin' or what film is gonna get sold. It should be about people gettin' together, and watchin' movies, and about people who could never get their movies seen havin' a chance to have it watched, if only once. A good film festival should be something where we all say, ""Gaw, let's forget about lawyers and managers and studios and celebrities. Let's forget all those things for just a while, and just watch some new art."" Nyyaarrrr! Hi, Chef. Your big chocolate balls are just the trick! Gosh. I guess I don't know my own strength. I couldn't have done it without you, Kyle.  Kisses. HOWDY HO! Christmas Time has come! Howdy-ho, folks. We're gonna do somethin' a little bit different tonight. Instead of our normal thing, we're just gonna sit back and enjoy some holiday songs. And if ya don't like it, well, I guess you can suck my tiny little balls. So let's start off with a festive Channukah song, sung by my favorite Jewish person in the whole world. Woohoo! Golly, that sure was fun. But now, for our next song, hold on to your bootstraps, 'cause we're gonna descend down into Hell! Well, that was a nice little song, wasn't it? But let's not forget that for some people Christmas is about the birth of Jesus. So now, here's a more serious Christmas song sung by Eric Cartman. Well, oh boy, that was a super song! And now, let's hear from the school teacher, Mr. Garrison. Golly, that sure was swell. I'd say my Christmas special is going super-fantastic. Well, now it's time to hear from perhaps the two most important people of the whole season. Well, I guess that's about the end of my Christmas album. Gosh! It was so nice hangin' out with you all again. Well, I guess if there's just... one thing I have left to say, it would be this: Hang a shining star above the highest bough. Goodbye, everybody,  and Merry Christmas!  MR. HANKEY Hoowwddyy ho! Oh, no I'm fine, Kyle. I know, Kyle. I've just been awfully busy with my family.  Honey! Boys, I want you to meet my wife. Autumn.

Santa, my friends are trying to do something very special this Christmas. Tell him, Eric. All right! Hey, it looks like Santa has already made it to Baghdad. It certainly doesn't seem very Christmasy of them. Santa! Are you alright? Hey, that's right. Jesus can save anybody. Tell Santa's workers to keep making toys. We'll have Santa back in no time! We should be able to find Jesus in no time! Hooowdy ho! Do you know a way? Howdy ho, Jesus. More soldiers are coming! Start the sleigh! What are you doin', Santa?

"SANTA","HOWDY HO, HO, HO... Hello, everybody! You know, Jesus, there've been so many songs written about us over the years. And heaven and nature sing... And heaven and nature sing... You know, Jesus, that is a nice song, but I like... this one: Up on the housetop, click click click. Go away?? Where away? Here's one, Jol- Hey, it's my turn. Uh. Santa Cl- em Saint Nicholas...

I was just starting to look over the new naughty and nice list the gnomes prepared for me. Oh no, they keep it open until midnight of Christmas Eve. Some kids actually try to cram in a lot of niceness right at the end. You know you're right. Santa hasn't been to that of the world in a looong time. Perhaps Santa could bring peace to this whole situation. Gnomes!  Load up the sleigh with toys! Santa's going to make a special run! And you boys can all watch me from our flight control room. Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas, everyone! Ho ho hoo! A Merry Christmas to all! Merry Christmas!  I'm hit! I'm hit! Hold on!  Sleigh is going down! North Pole. This is Santa. Sleigh is down.

Santa's legs are broken. I just couldn't do it.  I just couldn't let him live. He shocked Santa's balls! No!  Jesus. Jesus!  No... don't worry, Jesus, it's nothing. It's just a scratch.

Merry Christmas! Hohoho! Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! Hohohohoho! Ho ho ho! Everyone! Everyone, can I please have your attention?  Christmas is a very special time of year, but... this year it almost didn't happen. There's a man named Jesus who gave his life to save me. And so I declare that every year on Christmas Day. we should remember Jesus for what he did, and thank him for it. From now on, Christmas will be a day for remembering a brave man named Jesus. Now, if you'll all excuse me, I've got a lot of work to do. Oh, and boys, you might want to check under the Christmas tree.  Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! All right, what the hell is going on?!

"MS. ELLEN","Hello, children. Thank you, I'm sure I'll be fine. Now, children, I know that you must be very upset about your teacher having surgery... But I promise I'll try to make things as easy as possible for all of us. Now, let me try and learn your names by your seating assignments. (Reading off of paper) You are... Eric Cartman? Okay... And (Turning to Stan) YOU must be Stan Marsh! Do you need to go to the nurse's office, Stanly? So you're alright? Oh, goodness. Would anybody mind cleaning my erasers after class? Stan, how about you? Now, children, let's review our multiplication tables. Cartman? Didn't Mr. Garrison teach multiplication? Well, where did he leave off? Can I help you? And? I'm the substitute. That's very nice, Mr. Chef. Now if you're finished- That was enthralling, Mr. Chef. But, could I get back to teaching now? Fine, Chef, just let me do my job before I get fired. WHAT?! Okay, kids remember your homework. We have a lot of catching up to do! Of course, Wendy. (Laughing a little) Oh... Well I've taken a liking to ALL of you! You're all so young and cute and full of life! Of course, Wendy. What? Well, I certainly want to thank you all you lovely children for the presents you bought me... (Opening the box) Oh! What a delightful scarf! Thank you, Kyle! (Opening another) And here's one from Kenny... Oh, thank you very much, Kenny, this is a very scrumtious looking sausage. (Opening another) Oh, and what a nice alarm clock! Thank you Stan! And here's another present... From Wendy! Oh, why it's a dead animal. Thank you Wendy! Okay, kids, we're going to take a spelling test now. But, as an extra incentive, I'm gonna take whoever gets the highest score on the quiz out to dinner! Are there any questions before we begin? ...Yes, Wendy? Good morning children! Oh, Wendy, you wore black leather, too! We're like sisters!! Alright, kids, I've finished grading your papers, and the person with the highest score is... Really? Well, SURE! Oh, by the way kids, the person who scored highest on the quiz and gets to have dinner on me is... STAN!! I'm very glad we could have dinner together, Stanly. I want you to know that I really care about your education. Excuse me? What are you talking about? Stan, I'm your TEACHER. Okay? We're only FRIENDS. Well, first of all, you're eight. Oh, boy... Good morning, children. Sure, but can it wait until after class, Wendy? Oh, that's okay, Wendy. Well I would LOVE that, Wendy. Wendy, there's NOTHING between me and Stan! Okay, children, let's catch up on our cursive handwriting. It's a lie! NO! Principal Victoria, please! NO!! NOOO!!! (Struggling) THIS IS ALL A MISTAKE!! THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!! (Muffled) PLEASE!! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!"
"TOM","You shouldn't be embarrassed, Mr. Garrison. People have cosmetic surgery all the time. Before we start the surgery, this computer can help you pick what kind of nose you want. Now, we could go with something a little smaller, which would make you look like... This. Or, we could straighten out the bridge, which would make you look like this... Of course we could narrow the bridge, which would make you look more like -- This... Alrighty then. Now I must warn you, Mr. Garrison, that there ARE risks... You could wind up a hideous, foul, shadow of a creature, so terrifyingly ugly that you are forced to live in the sewers, only emerging at night to hunt for scraps of food. Alrighty then, let's get started! Mr. Garrison? Mr. Garrison? The operation is over, Mr. Garrison. You look great. Yes, well, that's to be expected. We did some major reconstruction. Sawed through some bone... snapped some cartilage. All the blood and mucus... Just the sound of bone and sinew coming apart... KKKKGH!! By the way... Did you ever see that movie 'Contact'? Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you get some rest? I'll check on you a little later... Okay, only a few more bandages to go... Take a look for yourself. Yes, I think once the swelling goes down you'll really notice a difference. ü¾ ¼And all over America, kids are turning to the streets and running away. Tonight, a very special message from the parents of some runaway children, in hopes that their young will hear their cries. Thanks, Creamy. Police are advising all citizens to stay indoors, not breathe the ashen air, and not ever light any giant snakes in the near future. I'm here live in South Park, Colorado, where citizens from Los Angeles are arriving in droves for the town's first annual film festival. This is just a small quiet mountain community where nothing out of the ordinary ever really happens,  except for the occasional complete destruction of the entire town and so the excitement level is naturally very high. Right now, the townspeople are anxiously awaiting the arrival of some of Hollywood's top celebrities. Ladies and gentlemen, TV's Fred Savage. Well, I'm sure a real person will show up soon. I ate all mine up, silly. Ooh, good idea. Let's. It appears that more and more South Park residents are discovering the wonder and joy of the planetarium. Here with a special report is a 34-year old Asian man who looks strikingly similar to Ricardo Montalban. Oh, anywhere would be great! Oh. Oh wait wait, I know this. What was second prize again? Now, Mary, this is our only vacation for years. We have to make the best of it Now, Mary, you promised me we'd try to have a good time. Huh, it's so cold here. Oh well, let's try to make the best of it, Mary. Yeah, and at least we've got our health. Good night, Jerry. Helen, no! Whoa, shit! Thanks, Chris. In other news, the FBI has finally caught the child molester known as Mr. Slippyfist.  This sick child molester was found with disturbing graphic photos of young boys naked, which we will show you now. Here's one. And here's another. Here, look at this one. Sick sonofabitch! Here's one right here. Oh my God, what are we gonna do? That's right, Chris. This newest study shows that the majority of child abductions are NOT commited by strangers, but by somebody the child knows in their own town.  The report further states that it is because the child trusts the individual that problems occur in the first place. Sure does, Tom. In other news, South Park police are still looking for a craaazy man who terrorized the town one hour ago.  The man claimed to be from the future and ran naked through the city streets screaming ""The past! The past! Oh my God, it's the past!"" Which is what one would expect someone in the future to yell. Right. What about the war? Uh huh, and what aspect of it do you think is most gay? Boys, what do you think the Founding Fathers would say? Tom, I'm standing in the town square where the war rally has been going on for an incredible eighty-seven hours. The crowd still appears to be split right down the middle - half of them support country music, and the other half rock-n-roll. Let's listen in. Craig! Behave yourself! Yeah. Everyone already knows I dress better than Randy. I mean, you do have the fashion sense of a Japanese woman. You don't... like us being metrosexual? You can metrobash us all you want, but we're here to stay! There's more little-league baseball for South Park! Yehheah!"
"MRS. KIMBLE","(hot for him) Oh, howdy, Mr. Garrison. Say honey, you look kinda different... Did you get a haircut? Call me! I'm in the book! Great Party, Wendy. Anything for you, sugarpie."
"PHOTOGRAPHER","Great, baby! You're looking great! Okay, just a few hundred more shots and we'll be done. Hey, that's the life of a model, baby. You got it. Come on, girls. Smile.  We want you to look happy. Smile.  Look at the silly frog. Who's got the silly frog? Look at him. I've got- Look at him. It's silly. ""I'm so silly."" Okay, smile  Okay, next? Take off your hat, please? Come on now, I bet your parents want a picture of YOU lookin' natural. Snile! Come on, where's that smile? Is it gonna kill you to smile? I see a smile. Very nice. Okay, last one? Okay, have a seat, young man.  Well, okay, lookin' great.Now where's that smile? Come on, give me a nice, wide smile. Wider. Perfect! Should be about four days. Okay gang, give me a big smile."
"IRAQI","DOWN! DOWN! EVERYBODY DOWN!! So, we meet again, Ms. Ellen!! I am Hakeem Korashki of the mighty nation of Iraq! This woman is a traitor to our government! She has killed thousands, and will kill again I assure you!! We must take her back to Iraq immediately! Here is a black and white photo of Ms. Ellen with our leader- Her REAL name is Makesh Alak Makarakesh! For crimes against this country, you are hereby sentenced to be shot into the center of the sun. SHAVA!!! Koorat de latn blak. Laken blak ba la laken. Iraken blak laken pharat."

"ANTHROPOLOGIST","Now, can anybody tell me WHO left these arrowheads here? Well, yes, but I want to see if you're learning anything. Okay, I tell you what, why don't we all grab our little anthropology pic axes that were handed out, and we'll dig for our very own Indian Arrowheads!! How's it going, boys? Let me see that. Why, this is Anastasi writing! My God, this must must be thousands of years old!!"
"ANCHOR","And finally tonight, a young boy from South Park, Colorado found something very interesting during a field trip today. Here with a special report is a quadriplegic Swiss man on a pony. Thanks, Tom. Those are some cute, cute kids. Except for that last one, he's a little tubby. With chicken after chicken being violated, the South Park police are under increasing pressure to solve the case of the chickenfucker. We now go live to a press conference where Officer Barbrady and the Mayor are fielding questions -- And so, Officer Barbrady has taken a leave of absence. And South Park will have to manage without any police force for a while -- -- This just in! South Park has just plunged into TOTAL ANARCHY!! Exactly 2 seconds after the retirement of Officer Barbrady, looting and pillaging erupted in the quiet mountain town! And so today, South Park held a parade to honor Officer Barbrady, and his heroic work on the Chickenfucker case. Fourth of July is finally here, and with the statewide ban on fireworks, people from all over Colorado are flocking to South Park. Here with a special report is a normal-looking guy with a funny name. All over America, the effects of the giant ash snake of South Park can be seen. The spontaneous combustion problem escalates as more and more peopel go back to holding in all their farts.  Meanwhile, the ozone layer continues to deplete as others refuse to hold in their farts for fear of combustion. As we all know, the cause for all of this is Randy Marsh, the son of a bitch who calls himself a scientist. We caught up with Mr. Marsh earlier today and he had this to say: What an asshole! I hate that guy, and so do you. And now, on to the weather. It's fucking hot, thanks to Randy Marsh, son of a bitch! Fighting the frizzies at 11. Frizzies at 11. Fighting frizzies at 11. ...to which Ms. Clinton replied, ""I don't even like Vagina."" Finally tonight, a human-interest story. Dan Akawa is live. A car chase is evolving on the 285 corridor east of South Park! Hate-crime suspect Eric Cartman is trying to outrun federal prosecutors in his friend's Go-Go Action Bronco! Our Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins is there live. Greg? Here's Lalapalalala's news. The hit group Timmy has broken up. And so, Phill Collins is back on as the headliner. The opening band now will be Timmy's guitarist Skyler's new solo project, Reach for the Skyler. Kindergarten teacher Herbert Garrison has apparently invented a new vehicle that will give the airlines a run for their money. Mr. Garrison is putting the final touches on his top secret device, which he simply calls ""IT"". So what exactly is ""IT""?  Here with a report is a Hispanic man with some gravy stains on his lapel. Another death tonight by a senior citizen motorist. Carl Zorn of Pine Junction was killed instantly when struck by a vehicle driven by Pete and Lydia Malman, who were trying to find Country Kitchen Buffet. This latest tragedy comes only two days after the accident in Deer Creek, where three construction workers and a bulldozer  were run down by senior citizen Paul Thom , who was trying to find Country Kitchen Buffet. Public outcry is forcing the DMV to consider suspending the licenses of all seniors over seventy, though no decision has yet to be made. This is HBC News. A right-to-die case debate is heating up in Colorado,  where Kenny McCormick's feeding tube has been removed by his BFF.  Two boys are bringing national attention to this story by protesting outside the hospital. A woman was arrested for trying to bring food to the patient. However, a growing number of people are also standing behind Kenny's BFF, Eric Cartman. The biggest battle of all time is about to begin: the battle of the feeding tube! As people on both sides of the argument vie for media attention. We've just received word that Kenny McCormick... has passed away. The debate still rages on in America, but at least now, Kenny... is in a much more peaceful place."
"LEONARD MALTIN","Leonard Maltin, yes. I know who you are. You must listen to me, Chef. We have precious little time. Have you seen Barbara Streisand recently? (Snapping) HAVE YOU SEEN HER?!?! Thank God, then I'm not too late. Chef, it is of the utmost importance that you tell me where those little boys from the news report on TV are. Damn! Then we must look for them elsewhere! If Barbara Streisand saw the same news report I did, then those boys are in grave danger... If YOU were Barbara Streisand, where would you be right now? No, no! I mean where would she be staying? Where?! Dammit, man, where is your car?!?! Are you sure Barbara Streisand has a condo up here? Then we've got to keep looking... Haven't you ever been curious about the insanity Barbara Streisand exhibits? MORE THAN A BITCH, Mr. Chef!! She is a calculating, self-centered egotistical... bitch. She was born in a small town, her mother was a Jackel and her father was an insurance salesman! (Rapidly) When she was five, she knew that she wanted to be a famous singer. But by the time she was six, her ambitions became to rule the universe. She learned of an ancient diamond. The diamond of Pantheous. (Very quickly) Before she was seven, the keepers of Pantheous learned of this insane little girl's wish. The diamond was split up and buried at opposite ends of the world. But then, during the shooting of My Fair Lady, Barbara Streisand found one of the triangles... Yes... Mr. Chef, if Babs gets a hold of that other triangle, she will fulfill her prophecy and become the most threatening thing ever known to mankind... MECHA-STREISAND. Looks like we'll have to go to plan B. Have you ever heard of the band called 'The Cure'? No, no... Just the lead singer. AGH!! AGH!! She's close! She's very close! I can feel her. She has the boys! They're in trouble!! Keep going this way, hurry!! Oh, no! She has joined the two triangles? Stand back, Chef! (Japanese Accent) MARUTIN RAY!! I've got to go after Mecha-Streisand! Chef, I need you to call Robert Smith of The Cure at this number. BARBARA!!!!!!!!!!!!!! KITTE! KITTE! CHURI-PU!!! We must tell him that her weak point is the nose..."
"MS. STREISAND","Who is the boy I saw on the News report tonight? Hello there, little boy. Do you know who I am? Oh I bet you do- (Singing) I'm going... Where there's lucky clovers in the sun... I'm Barbara Streisand! So?! (Composing herself) So... I'm a VERY famous and VERY important individual. WHAT?! No! Look, little boy, I understand that you found a neat little triangle near here. You know what I'm talking about? (Excited) Little boy, does the triangle have a symbol of two snakes joined at the middle? Okay, now this is VERY important... Where is the Triangle of Zinthar now? I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU, YOU PISSANT LITTLE HICK!!! WHERE IS THE TRIANGLE, DAMMIT? Problemo? There's no problemo, Officer. I was just introducing myself to these... CHARMING little boys. Well? YOU know who I am, don't you? AAAGHGH!!!!! He has it Milo... That little bastard has the triangle. I'm sure! He knew about the symbol of Krulock!! A cop showed up. He's a clever one. I can't blow everything now that I'm this close. Everything must be handled very carefully. How many years has it been, Milo? Thirty? Forty? For so long I have waited to find the other triangle... And now I am so close... The dawn of Zinthar is close at hand!!!! Soon, the triangle of Zinthar will be mine, and I WILL BE THE BIGGEST, MOST FAMOUS PERSON EVER!!!! You fools have no idea the powers that you are meddling with! I'll teach you to meddle with MY TRIANGLE!! (Music stops) NOW do you remember?!?! Alright, YOU ASKED FOR IT!!!

"DISGUISED BABS","Oh, hello there little boys. How are you today? That is great. My name is Mrs. Jones. And I am a very friendly, nice person. I hear that one of you found my triangle. Yes. You see, that triangle is part of my Kidney Dialysis machine. I'm so glad you found it, because without it, I was sure to die within hours. But I'll die! I want to give you a BIG cash reward for finding it. It's worth a lot of money to me. Oh, ha, ha... Who is that? (Screaming) ENOUGH!!! (Getting back in character) Uh, ha-ha... Anyway, if you'll come with me in my car, I'll take you up to my condo where I'll kill you -- I mean -- give you money for the triangle."
"DIRECTOR","And... ACTION!! Cut! Great, print that! Excellent work, Sid. Take five guys, let's set up for the next shot. Mayor! Mayor! My name is Sid Greenfield. I'm the director from Los Angeles for 'America's Most Wanted'. We're desperate for stories. (Catching himself) AND this one is so compelling! Sure! This story has everything! People... furniture... talking... It's a real American story. We just want to do a recreation of the story for our show. Then we'll flash a number on the screen that people can call if they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter. That's it. You win. We win. America wins. Don't worry, Mayor, America's Most Wanted is not about violence, it's about family. Great! We'll get started with auditions immediately. What part should we cast first? Oh, thank you very much, we'll get back to you. I think I've seen enough genetic engineers. Let's move on to the auditions for the part of... (Looking at papers) Mr... Garrison. Alright, not bad.

This is Josh Casher. He'll be playing the role of your future son. Yes, and he knows all your family history and every detail of your house. And he's worked up quite a future for your son. Alright, then we'll put the fake news report out on Tuesday night. Make sure your son is watching the Channel 4 News. Motivation Corp. takes care of everything. Just follow these simple scripts when your actor arrives. So, everything is working out with your future actor? Your son seems to be responding. Well, you know what us ultra-liberals say, when it comes to children and drugs, lies are OK. The ends justify the means. We'll take smoking, for instance. The truth is there's no hard evidence that second-hand smoke can kill but, we believe it's okay to lie about it as long as it gets people to stop smoking. So it is with everything here at Motivation Corp. It's okay for us to lie and tell kids that all marijuana supports terrorism. Or that... one pill of Ecstacy is gonna kill them. It's not necessarily true, but the ends justify the means. Oh God, who smeared crap all over our walls?! Oh Jesus, it smells! Oh!"

All right, folks, this is the little boy we're looking for:  Leopold Stotch, also known as Butters. He's been missing for two days and was last seen at the school. Let's go find him. All right, folks. I wanna thank you for all your efforts. Three days is a long time, but we've got to keep going if we're gonna find him. Many times in cases like these a child can trap themselves. It is important that we spread our search to duct pipes, wells, and bomb shelters. I say we need to move the search to ducts, wells, and bomb shelters. Let's move out, people! Every second counts!"

Don't feel too bad, your mom was just too drunk to remember what happened. Let me tell you... We got tired of dancing, so we went off to find a private spot. I knew that she wanted me because she kept saying romantic things. Woa! Hello! Huh? You gotta be kidding me!! He's the last person I saw with your mom that night."

I'M GOING TO SEE TO IT THAT YOU BOTH PAY FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE!! AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?!?! NO! Because I hate you! You think farting is so funny! Well it isn't! Fart jokes are the lowest form of comedy, and -- AGH!!! I hate you both!! I've hated you ever since I can remember, I hate you, and I wish you both had cancer. Yes. In the head. This is NOT the end TERRANCE AND PHILLIP! YOU'LL RUE THIS DAY!!! Hello? Yes. Yes, I'm a television critic for magazines. Yes, Yes I do! They think that fart jokes are a sophisticated form of comedy, but they're not! Who IS this? Saddam Hussein? The Iraqi dictator?! What do you want? I'm not sure that I should trust you. Scott to Red Dragon. Come in Red Dragon. The plan is working perfectly. Terrance and Phillip have taken the bait. Yes. Everything's proceeding according to plan. Now you promised that when Terrance and Phillip arrive they will be ripped into pieces and shot several times. Roger, red dragon. Scott out. (under his breath) I've got you now, you fart loving fart lovers... Hey Saddam, you helped me get rid of Terrance and Phillip, and I appreciate that... But why are framed pictures of you going up all over Canada? No I don't need a rest! I want to know what this is all aboot! I thought you were from Iraq. Hey! What the hell are you guys doing here? You're not supposed to be here! You're supposed to be in Iran looking for your kidnapped -- Uh... I mean, uh... How are you today? Nothing. Why? What? Ah! I hate you more you more than ever Terrance and Phillip! I absolutely abhor you both! I'm wishing cancer upon you. That's right! I'm trying to give you cancer with my mind. What's so funny? Saddam! Terrance and Phillip are back in Canada! You promised me they'd be gone for good! That was your part of the bargain! This deal is getting worse all the time. Terrance, this is Scott. Just shut up and listen. You've unleashed a monster onto Canada and only you can get rid of him. Even though I hate you, and I wish you had cancer. YOU'RE a dick. YOU'RE a dick. ... YOU'RE a dick. The two of you are the most annoying dicks in Canada! You give other Canadians a bad name... and if I had... Sure. You son of a bitch! I'll get you if it's the -- Sure. GOD DAMMIT!! Sure... I mean No! You listen to me! If you want to save Canada, you'll meet me at Karl's Kraft Dinner Restaurant in half an hour. What are you idiots doing? Is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can't be described? Listen, I have an inside scoop. There's an Iraqi dictator who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada. Well, what are you two gonna do aboot it? It's YOUR fault that he's here! YOU brought the Iraquis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter. That's right, and now you must make amends. Tomorrow Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada at the RoughridersRoughriders football game. All his soldiers will be there. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this. It's a bomb. You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam's minions. Well, you must do it, for Canada. Yes... Yes... Terrance and Phillip. And when the dust has settled, Canada will be rid of both the Iraqis... AND your immature fart humor! What the hell happened! You were supposed to be blown up! Oh! That is SO JUVENILE!!! Of course. I HATE YOU TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!! And so I told him, I said ""Here. I'll sell you my pubes for only ten bucks."" And this stupid asshole buys them! Speak of the devil! What do you want? Uh uh, I don't take returns! You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think soho! Buyer beware, dude! Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little butt out of here before I kick your head in! You're not from the IRS! You glued my pubes onto your face! Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes back for the money. How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty? Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just... give me the six dollars.  And then I'll... give you the twenty. Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give you back two dollars.

But... just one thing before I give it to you: I just... well... I want you to beg for it. Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money. Do you want your grandma to live or not?! Nono, get down on your knees.  Lower your head , and say ""I beg you to give me back my money."" Now say, ""I'm a little piggy."" Say it! ""Here's my snout."" ""Oink oink oink."" Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink for me! You mean this?  You really care that much about sixteen measly dollars? I mean, what can you buy with sixteen dollars?! My parents give me a fifty dollar-a-week allowance. This pittance means nothing to me. Watch. Now you can't bug me for your dumb money! Uh huh. Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing Pube Boy! Hello? What do you want?! How do you know? Thennn why are you telling me? Oh. See ya. Hey. Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great. Wow, a pony ride. Neat. Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want? What? How can I turn it down? Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there's a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's been abandoned. Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do. Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now. I'm proud of you, too, Mom. What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods? Awesome! The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town! Oh, I wouldn't miss this for anything. Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first? Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize. Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh? Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it. Eh, it's a special recipe I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you.

And by helping Americans, you're just as smelly as they are! Now I'm going to get you! Who the hell are you?! Ugh! This isn't over! Not by a long shot! I'll fix you. I'll fix all of you!! Not so fast! Prime Minister, these are the child's Canadian parents! Their Canadian blood pumps through his veins! Would you send him back to America with those world-hungry scum?! Haha, you lose, Americans!"
"JUDGE","Madame foreperson, have you reached a verdict so we can get hell out of here? You're gonna have to repeat that verdict because we had some flatulence issues. Eric Cartman, you have been found guilty of commiting a hate crime. For this, I hereby sentence you to the Alamosa Juvenile Hall, until you turn twen-ty one. I am making an example of you, to send a message out to people everywhere: that if you want to hurt another human being, you'd better make damn sure they're the same color as you are!  Court is adjourned! Bailiffs, escort this little bastard to Juvenile Hall. I'm sorry to say that my hands are tied. The new Prime Minister of Canada has authority this court cannot override. By Canadian law I must award custody of the child to his birth parents. Uuhh, excuse me. I uh, just found the last page of Kenny's will. I found the page where Kenny specified his wishes about being on life support. If I should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on life support, please...  for the love of God, don't ever show me in that condition on national television."

Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy! Ah hahaha! Aaaaaah! Die, pussy! Aaaah! Hell, you can't leave me, Satan! I won't let you! There you are! You know you can't live without me. Now GET THAT ASS BACK TO BED! You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves me. Aw, you little -prick!

There won't be anyone stopping this great ladder from being built today! Alpha Team! Get that support structure up! Ciranom's Team! Get us photos and recon! Not quite, but we have a new problem, Mr. President. Our recon team on the ladder just found new evidence of threats... from Saddam Hussein. Yes sir. And now we believe he's building weapons of mass destruction... in heaven. These surveillance photos were taken atop the ladder of what appears to be heaven.  Here we see what we believe to be a missile silo. And here  we see what looks like a laboratory of some sort for making chemical weapons. Yes. It could be a laboratory disguised as a seagull. Sir, you must understand our fears. We must take out those facilities. We must...  bomb heaven! So, you're saying we should bomb this moment, right now. Right! Johnson! Gentlemen, Ladies, we all know that we live in a time of uncertainty. The risk of an attack on American soil is higher than ever. Now, I believe we may be able to curb that risk. Two days ago our intelligence department came across this:  The AWESOM-O 4000. It is currently being used by Catamount Pictures to develop ideas for movies. Our sources say that in just one week it has come up with over one thousand movie ideas, eight hundred of which feature Adam Sandler. No. If we got our hands on that robot, we could reprogram it and turn it into a weapon!. Unethical? Let me explain something to you, Mr. Scientist! We understand that the robot is from Japan! That means that the Japanese have more of them! And if the Japanese fabricates one of them into a weapon before we do... You're paid to think, Mr. Scientist! National security is our jub.  Gentlemen, we're going to Los Angeles!  I want that robot! Are those arm and leg locks secure? Good. I don't want that robot mobile until I know what it's capable of. All right, power it on. What's going on? Stand by. Be ready to destroy it. What's happening? What? How can that be? Speak in a language we can understand, Mr. Scientist! Who made you, robot?! But, who would have programmed it to think it was human? The movie studio? Dear Christ, they gave it memories, too. Do I have to remind you of your position?! Don't forget you have a duty to your country,  Mr. Scientist!! I want that robot's memories and consciousness E-RASED, so we can take it back to Washington! GOT IT?! What the hell are you doing?! Fine. Kill that son of a bitch! Perhaps... there is consciousness in this robot. Maybe we as a society need to realize that artificial intelligence... is intelligence all the same, and we can learn from the robots.

Yes, this is what we would refer to as the FORTIETH trimester. Well, but we prefer to abort babies a little earlier on. In fact, there's a law against abortions after the second trimester. Hmmm... I'm afraid I can't help you, Ms. Cartman. If you want to change the law, you'll have to speak with your congressman. You have to admit you have a problem before anyone can help you. Nonsense!

"PRESIDENT","Well okay Mrs. Cartman, I'll legalize fortieth trimester abortions for you. We'll have the pregnancy terminated immediately. Oh yes, that's what an abortion is. Adoption? Well that's pretty different. This is not good. It makes our country look poor and stupid. You know what to do. Uh Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, as President of the South Park Milk Company, I want to apologize personally for printing that falsified picture on our milk cartons. Ye-yes, but here at South Park Milk we strive for excellence. For instance, we are now entering the extraction room. As you can see, we keep it close to the refrigeration room. That way we can get the milk to the container as fast as possible.  That's why some say South Park milk tastes like you're suckin' it right from the cow's tits yourself. Here, try a glass of our cold Vitamin D. And our fresh scones. Really? Well. And in here we have our Missing Child Resource Center. Yes. With the Kelrom 4000, Mrs. Garthunk can search a database of over 30 million missing child cases. So you actually haven't seen your son in over 20 years? Well, why don't we let Mrs. Garthunk do her work, and I'll take you two out for some good old Colorado chili. And so it is with great pride that we have flown little Billy Thompson out here, to be reunited with his parents for the first time in twenty years. Mrs. Garthunk? Come around here, Ben! Isn't this wonderful?"

Yeah, but you know, it-it doesn't matter though, the- the Denver team always wins, okay? Could I get some more pork? The- the school could put out pamphlets, mkay? And we could have seminars to educate, mkay? Welcome to detention. Mkay. Mr. Garrison told me about your little joke. Important for you all to know why you are in detention. For you to obtain the full benefits from it. You're here because you are inferior, mkay? You're here because you are awkward, mkay? Shh! 'Kay? Shh! 'Kay? Oh oh okay? Let's try to calm down, nkay? This type of thing happens all the time. Well, 99% of the time, when a child is missing, it's because they've run away. Mkay? Well, we just need to make some posters, nkay? Hand out brochures, onkay?

Uh, there's only one way to get any sense out of him. We're gonna have to try a mind meld, mkay? Well, it's an ancient technique handed down from school counselor to school counselor. I don't like to use it, but it may be our only hope. Just time to prepare, nurse. Just time. Mkay? Our minds are one. Mkay? Our thoughts are one. Mkay? Please, nurse, for a woman with a dead fetus on your head, you're not being very open-minded.  Open your mind to your counselor. Open your mind. Yes. Mkay? Abuh. Please, nurse, you're throwin' off my chi! Mkay? Aha! Caught you red-handed! Mkay! Officer Barbrady, uh, this man is using some kind of mind control. Oh no, apparently, he thinks he's Charlton Heston. Uh oh. Eric, you really saved the day. Mkay? Think hard, Elvis. You're not really the king of rock and roll. You're a fat, stupid, worthless policeman in a small town. Mkay? Nowuh, young man, uhschool is a time for learning, mkay? Not for immature skylarkings. You know, like tomfooleries. Oh, your parents are here. Thank you for coming on such short notice. I was just disciplining your son for his skylarkings. Yeahmkay? Okay.

I am tired of seeing you in my office, young man!  You get sent here every day, Craig! Why can't you behave? What do you have to say for yourself?! Well, I tell you what, young man. Uh, you're gonna be held back a grade if you don't luh-  Did you just flip me off? Yes you did, you just flipped me the bird! Now, see? This is exactly what I'm talking about! If you don't shape up, mkay, and get your head straight, uh-  There! You just flipped me off again! Yes you did! And until you stop flipping people off, you can just go back to the waiting room, mkay?! Next!  Well, well, well, if it isn't Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Eric. Sit down, boys. Now, let's see. What did Mr. Garrison send you in here for? ""The boys were being rude while a choir teacher was giving some stupid presentation-"" Uh, young man, ""Getting Gay With Kids"" is not dumb, mkay? It just so happens that I'm on the board of directors. Well, guess what, boys? I think that ""Getting Gay With Kids"" is just what you need. I'm gonna sign up all four of you. I think this will be very good for you And that's exactly why you need to go! Sorry I'm late. Oh, no problem.  Usted es choir de Estados Unidos, mbien? Uh, he says Pablo here will take you on a rainfoest tour. Buenos dias, Seü¾¼or Presidente, ü¾¦¼mbien? (Hello, El Presidente) Uh, muy bien.

(I'm sure the choir will be here. We just need a little more time) Mbien. Hi, boys. Have you guys been sure to pass gas regularly so you don't spontaneously combust? Well, let me show you, just to be sure, mkay?  Hmm, come on. Be good, now. I had a steak wrapped with bacon last night. So, you boys understand you have to do that regularly, oh-mkay? Jakovasaurs kinda piss me off, mkay. Uh, your honor, this young man commented on the shape of my ass. Mhm, mkay? Hello! Welcome, hmkay? This is already a wild party, hm. Oh, that's okay. I've got a special kids' room down in the basement. Be sure to help yourselves to the crab soufflü¾¼, and uh, eh, Juanita?  Juanita? We need some more finger sandwiches? Here you go, it's right in here. We'll come get you kids when the meteor shower starts. Anyone for some meteor mai tai punch? It packs quite a whallop. Come on! Loosen up! Meteor showers only come once in a great while. Here it is. I just had the hot tub put in last week. Yeah, you can get a lot of action when you have a hot tub. Sure, go ahead. It's a-it's a party, isn't it? Mkahy? Hm huheh, that's okay. Oh, come on in. Join the party, mkay? Would you like a meteor mai tai? Well, are you sure you have to leave so early? Mkay. Drive carefully, mkay? Uh this is Cher. This is her new album. Hoh, look. Harold's doing it again, hm huh hnmkay? Uh. Well, it's not like you're the only guy who's ever watched another guy masturbate; I've done it. Uh, Juanita, could you fix some more dip, please, Juanita? Only one? M'kay, that sounded great, kids. M'kay, kids. Uh, we have some news. Uh, there's been a terrible flood in Oklahoma, m'kay? So the 4-million-recorder-children's event is being moved to Arkansas. Eh, the trip shouldn't take any longer, but I'll hand out these updated contact sheets so that your parents will know where you are, m'kay? M'kay. What? We can't find anybody to fill in for you. Why can't you go to Arkansas? Well, don't you want to see them? Uh, perhaps you should sit down, Mr. Garrison, m'kay?  Mr. Garrison, I know this is very difficult, m'kay, but I must ask: is there a history of sexual abuse in your family? When was that? M'kay, eh, and your father? He molested you when you were a boy?  Mr. Garrison, I think, when we get to Arkansas, you need to see your father. You need to face this demon in your closet, m'kay? M'kay. Mr. Garrison, are you alright? M'kay-Mr. Garrison, you're just having a hard time dealing with the memories of your father's sexual abuse, so you switch personalities to Mr. Hat, m'kay? M'kay-I think the best thing for Mr. Garrison to do is to go see his father M'kay! Mr. Hat, you need to let me talk to Mr. Garrison, m'kay?! What did you say?! Why, you son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick your ass, m'kay?! Yuh-NO!  You may have won this time, Mr. Hat. M'kay, I want everyone to stay together, m'kay? Nobody move! Excuse me? Oh, uh we're from South Park, Colorado? Uh, Mr. Garrison, Sr.? Uh, my name is Mr. Mackey. I'm your school counselor, m'kay. Uh-I wanna talk to you about your sonü¾³¤¼I'm his n-therapist, m'kay. Eh, you didn't? Oh. Hm. Uh, I guess that's a little different. Well, now, uh, what's he supposed to think, Mr. Garrison? I mean, uh, look at all the media, all the magazine ads and televison ads talkin' about ""sexual molestation"", m'kay? He sees all that and assumes you didn't molest him because of some flaw in his looks or personality. I know, I know, but I'm afraid this problem has run very deep through Mr. Garrison's mental state. I'm worried that if... you don't do womething, well it could kill him. There comes a time in every father's life when he must ask himself, ""How far will I go to save my son's life?"" Well, I've said all I can say.  I know it's difficult, but... family... is about compromises. m'kay?  Don't lose your son over this, Mr. Garrison.  Don't lose... your son, m'kay? Uh, aren't those our boys? Alright, come on, everybody. We've got a long bus ride back to Colorado, m'kay? Uh, queef is a vaginal expulsion of gas, m'kay. And what you need to understand is that this is not appropriate behavior, young man! M'kay? Well, I hope you learned that throwing rocks is bayad, Eric. Not this time, Eric! You've got to learn to respect your lttle friends! You're gonna have detention for two weeks! Yes way! M'kay, and that settles it! Now, let's all go- Yes? Nn-um. m'kay, uh, I've already taken care of it; Eric Cartman here is gonna be punished with two weeks of detention. Uh, oh, but I don't think this is a ruh- Oh no. Uh young man, if you don't wanna be held back a grade, I suggest you start cooperating, m'kay?! Huh- hold on just a second there, Principal Victoria.  I think I may know what the problem is. Yes, of course. I think maybe Timmy is suffering from something called, ""Attention Deficit Disorder,"" or ADD. It's very common in kids his age. It should be easy enough to find out. They have tests for that kind of thing now, m'kay? M'kay. Oh oh, I nuh-I knew it. Okay, well, maybe you need to view this as a chance to do something you've always wanted to do. Well, there you go, m'kay? Well that's easy. Write about what you know. Write about what you love. What do you love most? Yes. M, m'kay Well that settles it, Mr. Garrison. What you need to do is go write a great romance novel. Oo, Wednesday? Uh-Wednesday's tough. I guess- maybe I could do somthin' uh, Thursday afternoon. Oh, yeah. Yeah, Tuesday morning's good. Yeah, I think that's the best day. Oh, Mrs. Cartman, I've been uh very bad. M'kay? Oh, yeah, that makes me hot, m'kay? Uh, God is our refuge and strength, m'kay. A very present help in trouble, m'kay.  Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea... God is in the midst of her, m'kay. She shall not be moved, m'kay.  Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, m'kay, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof, m'kay. There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place- Uh, you see, Chef, Ms. Choksondik has very large, uh, honkers, and she doesn't seem to like wearing a bra. No, it's really not as nice as you might imagine, Chef, m'kay. We... don't like to talk about it. After being dismissed from teaching, he went off to write romance novels. His first novel sold well and everything was fine until he found out that his novel won the gay Pulitzer prize, and was considered the best homoerotic novel since Huckleberry Finn. Well, we really haven't ll-looked. What? Oh, that's great, Mr. Garrison. You've finally come to terms with yourself! Every year the fourth graders do ""The Miracle Worker,"" and every year I have to sit and watch it. Eric, your friends and your family are all... concerned about your weight. M'kay? Now, Eric, all these people came here and paid to send you to camp because they care about you. Uh what's all this about, Mrs. Cartman? Is Eric having trouble at havin' trouble at his weight-management camp? Eric, that's fantastic, m'kay?! Christmas is about presents. If we all buy presents, everyone benefits. M'kay? Oh, I don't really give a shit. I've done enough shit outside today and shit. Sh. We're watching ""Behind the Blow,"" m'kay. Okay, boys, this is the first day of sexual education, m'kay? Now, I know that some of you think this is very funny. Words like ""penis"" and ""vagina."" Nuh now STOP that, m'kay! We're goin' tuh get through this by being mature and grown up, m'kay.  Now, this is the male anatomy, m'kay. Here we see the testes and the scrotum.  STOP that, m'kay! The next person that laughs is gonna get a referral!  M'kay. Now, in order to have intercourse, the man takes his penis, and he... hmmm... uhh... let's see: the the man takes his penis, and he... hm. Well, sure I have! It's just... I was about 19 at the time, so it's been about 21 years... m'kay. Let's see, uh... I'm pretty sure I took th-yeah I took the penis, and I bu- uh what the hell did I do with that damned thing?? Uh thanks so much for letting me come over, Ms. Choksondik. Yeah I've already gone over most of the basics, you know, uh with the boys, but I uh... eh just wanted to see what else you were teaching the girls, in case I... ""missed"" anything. Right! Oral sex, which of course would be... Penis or vagina, right. Oral sex, m'kay. Yeah, why d-uh, did you? Well uh, how long did you wait before you had... uh... doobers. Oh, I'm... I'm sorry. Ah actually I understand perfectly. I... I wasn't exactly the captain of the football team, either, huh huh, hehehuh,  anyhow  And then as I got older my... my head just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of my body stayed the same. That's how I got my nickname in college. ""That guy with the really big head."" Anyway, I... I sort of lost any confidence and fourd it possible to ever ask a woman out, mm, hm mm. Neither have I. Uh not me!  Huhuh, okay. Right. Alright, boys, I now have all the information I need to teach you the female anatomy, hm'kay.  M'kay, this part here is the vaginal opening.  This is where the man puts his- Eric, what the hell are you doing? Why are you wearing a condom? Eric, you can't get AIDS from just sitting around, you have to get it from sex. Yes. Yes! Now will you all pay attention, please?! The vagina and the clitoris are on the outside, and they are in fact very easily visible to the naked eye. Now here we can see the interior female anatomy. Things like the uterus and the ovaries are on the inside And here we see the tender, magical uterus. Here we see the enticing, voluptuous Fallopian tubes, m'kay. M'kay, so apparently the lesson plan tomorrow is s'posed to involve the secretion of bodily fluids, m'kay. Why, sure.  Hey uh I think I can... get through that stuff pretty quick, mm...  Uh, maybe we should come up with another lesson plan. Uh, right, right, uh, like in the ...nipples. It... says here that the uh, head of the penis is actually the... most sensitive... part, m'kay. And these... are the two areas most important to- I don't know. It doesn't feel wrong. I've been thinking about you a lot, Ms. Choksondik. I go crazy. Yeah. Hmm. G'oh, m'kay. Huh, what's wrong? Mm, oh, oh Ms. Choksondik. Okay! Okay! I do. I want you. M'kay. Well. No. Oh yeah. Woh. Aw, this feels so good, m'kay. Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay? Well, I can't think of anything that would be THAT funny. Oh, I see, well... Well, what did you used to think was funny? Well Eric, I suppose that, just like everything else, laughter can be relative - in, in other words, sometimes people see somethin' so scary that nothin' else scares them, so, the same could be true for funny things. It's possible, hm'kay?  But you know, if you have completely lost your sense of humor, you can always become a writer for the show, ""Friends"" .Ohokahay, huhuh. You didn't do anything wrong boys. We just need to talk to you. Have a seat.  Boys, uh... your little friend Kenny went to the hospital last night, m'kay.  And well, he's pretty sick. We know, and that's why he's going to need you boys to be strong for him, m'kay? He needs you now more than ever. Uh hey, yeah. We, we woulda never laughed about this before. I knew it would be funny someday!  AIDS! M'kay kids, let's take our seats, m'kay? I know this has been a difficult couple o'weeks for you all with the untimely death of your teacher, but it's time for us to try to move on and learn, m'kay? No. Eric, what we're gonna do is learn to hide our emotions with math problems. M'kay, so let's start with some multiplication tables over here, m'kay. First we'll do uh, four time four, m'kay? Okay, and so uh,  so who can tell me the answer to the first problem, six times eight? Uh, Bebe? M'kay. Kids, I asked you to write a paper to read aloud for the class. Now, who want to start?  M'kay, class. M'kay, very nice, Clyde. Uh, Token, why don't you read your paper? M'kay, interesting, Token, Uh... Who would like to go next?  Uh how about someone who didn't write about how cool Bebe is? M'kay, Bebe? M'kay. Wendy, why don't we hear your paper? M'kay. Kids, we need to talk about your failing grades. M'kay, we all need to start studying more and fighting less, m'kay? Aw, that's so sweet, m'kay? M'kay, kids, so, now, who can tell me what year the first moon landing took place?  Uh, how about you, Clyde? No helping!  M'kay, I'm not really sure havin' all the parents here is a good idea, m'kay? Oh, this is too much to take.  Mom, Dad, could you please leave me alone? M'kay. M'kay kids, I know the past few weeks have been really hard with the death of your teacher, Ms. Choksondik. BUT... the principal has finally hired a teacher to take her place. So I want you all to give your best behavior to your new Fourth Grade teacher, Mr. Garrison. Good luck, m'kay. Parents, I had to call you in here because your boys have refused to attend class with their homosexual teachers, m'kay? Well there is an intensive seminar camp. It's a bit severe, but it might be the only way. M'kay? We're gonna talk to you one at a time, boys, m'kay? Kenny, will you step into my office, please? Come on, Kenny, let's go, 'k? Uh, that's nice, Officer Barbrady, but we actually don't need to know- It's too late, boys, m'kay? We already know everything.

This country was founded on the right to protest! M'kay? Well up yours, rednecks! Hey... That's a terrific idea! All right everyone, thank you all for comin' out to protest the war, m'kay? . And now, Randy Marsh is gonna sing a protest song he wrote about the war. And now we'd like to bring out a couple of very special South Park students who did a report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about the war. What? The Founding Fathers would have protested like us! I guess we... owe you an apology. And still tells the world that we don't. That was very good, Kyle. I think the Latino Endowment Council was very happy with your presentation. Looks like you might win. Here she comes! Here she comes! We have plenty enough to save our town now! It's over, Stanley. What else can we do? But, what do we do now? I mean, we can't just stand here and block their way forever. M'kay, kids, can I have it quiet, please? M'kay? M'kay, quiet now, the assembly's about to start, m'kay. M'kay, quiet ple-m k-m'kay?  M'kay. Uh, now kids, we have a really fun motivational group today who are gonna talk to you about the dangers of smoking, hm'kay? So please give a very big South Park Cows welcome to, ""Butt Out!"" Boys, what are you doing back here? I asked you a question: What are you doing back here, 'k?! What?? Well hey, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you boys have been smoking! Well you'd better not! Because let me tell you some'n' about smokin'!  Uh, smokin's bad, m'kay.  And uh, if you start smokin' at an early age, m'kay, ih it's gonna be bad.  M'kay, because uh, smoking can lead to all kinds of health problems like cancer.  M'kay, and let me tell you something about cancer, m'kay. Cancer's bad. M'kay, and uh, eh, what?  What the?  Holy shit! M'kay?! Wait a minute, what? You're right, boys, m'kay? Oh, hi Timmy. Come on in.  I understand you have somethin' important you wanna talk to me about, m'kay? Well, Timmy, as your counselor, I want you to know that you can tell me anything, hm'kay? And whatever's troublin' you, I wanna try and, and help you with it. Mhm'kay, right, you're Timmy. ...You, you have a problem? Ji-Jimmy? Oh, Jimmy Valmer! Oh, okay, what about him? Mmmmm'kaaay. I don't quite follow, Timmy. Right, Jimmy Valmer. Right. He's Jimmy, yeah. M'kay, that's one more vote for Turd Sandwich. It's pretty close, but it looks like Giant Douche is gonna win. Stan's vote bring the total votes for Turd Sandwich to... thirty six! And Giant Douche has... one thousand four hundred and ten. Giant Douche still wins. Uh, Eric, we're, we're talkin' about potholes right now, m'kay. Uh huh hi Eric, uh, how's it goin'? We know you can do it, Eric. You're smart. Wha- why you're the smartest kid in school, m'kay? They, they s- they stopped. Somethin's wrong.

R r right now, right now it is? on'kay, on'kay. Don't worry, Jimmy.  N'kay, uhhh, let's pick someone else, um. Eric, why don't you come up here? Well, because uh, Jimmy is pitching a tent right now.

First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down. Why? I don't know. I was drunk. Well, that certainly would explain a lot. Well, like this.

We are now entering Ensenada, the second largest city on the Mexican Baja Peninsula. We have now traveled over 2000 miles since leaving New York City. We'll just be stopping here for a few moments for gas, and then our tour will continue on to its final destination. Quey? What's stuck to the bottom of the bus? Oh, goodness! We must have run over a little Mexican further up north. Is it okay? Well, here's fifty for the gas.  Adios. Well, well, what are doing out here? You shouldn't be out walking the streets. Can I interest you in some ice cream? Alrighty, do you want this kind or this kind? Hang on, we'll be back at camp in a matter of no time. You'd better watch yourself next time, abandoner!

But it shows how Christ suffered for you. Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man. Sorry kid, we've got orders from corporate headquarters. You're gonna have to talk to the higher-ups. Bentonville, Arkansas. That's where Wall*Mart started, that's where all the bigwigs are. Oh dear... All right, Ms. Hilton, we'll find you another dog.

I don't think you can actually- All right, all right, come on- come on, young man Wow, my friend Brittany was right. This is a really laid-back place. Oh wow, you guys shouldn't be doing that. Don't you know what you're doing to the world? We just spent our first semester at college. Our professors opened our eyes. The government is using its corporate ties to make you sell magazines so they can get rich. Just hang with us for a bit. We'll fill you in on everything you haven't been told. You see, the corporations take their profits and invest it in the war machine while keeping everyone blind. Well, so my idea was this: Let's have like a weeklong music festival, draw everyone here, and then together, we can tear it all down.  Whoa, what the hell?! Who was that? Wow, this band is so crunchy. Dude, I need more weed. You kids just haven't been to college yet. But just you wait, this thing is about to get HUGE. Oh yeah, lever four, sweet!"

Ih-it's okay, Ms. Broflovski. Really. No, I'm quite secure with it. They're just young boys. Joking is a way for them to come to terms with what they don't understand. Yes, Principal Victoria, the thought had occurred to me. Unfortunately, it would mean my death. No, really, I don't need a- I- really- appreciate what you're trying to do here, but it's not necessary. I'm- a pretty happy person. But I really don't think- You know, Mayor, I really should be accompanying those kids to Washington in case they get hurt. That is my job. Oh, no! Nurse Gollum. Oh boy. Thank you, Mayor.

Don't you realize that the last thing I ever wanted was to be singled out? I just wanted to do my job and live my life like any normal person, but instead, you've made everybody focus on my handicap all week long.  Look, I don't want to be treated different. I don't want to be treated special orh-or treated gingerly or-I just want to be ridiculed, shouted at, and made fun of like all the rest of you do to each other.  And take those stupid things off your heads! I'll give him a pain killer. That should calm him down. He's stable, but I still can't get any information out of him. I'm gonna sedate him now.

Would you do me a favor? Next time you want to scare the hell out of my child, just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead? Oh, hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother. Ms. Cartman, is your son at home? Well, now I am worried. I've tried all the houses and nobody knows where they are. What do ya mean?! How often does an entire third-grade class go missing?! Run away? Let's get started right away! They could be halfway to L. A. by now. No, uh-no, she's been perfectly healthy. Shelley, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan. Will my daughter be okay? Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go. ü¾ ¼and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape now, but if she were in her twenties, she could die. So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chicken pox. Let them get it now, while they're young. So it's not such a crazy idea after all? Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final! Okay, lemme see.  Oh, goody! You've got a fever! Yyup, it looks like you've got chicken pox alright. Oh, gee, I guess you did. All right, it's off to bed with you, young man. Stanley, can I get you anything else? Stanley? Ohmigod! Randy?! Randy, hurry, he's burning up! Don't you worry, Stanley. You're going to be okay. Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay? Oh God, what have we done? Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick. Now, Stanley, I know at your age teachers can seem cold and heartless, but later, you'll understand that he did this for your own good. Oh. Well, anyway, here's a pencil and some paper. Yeah, and then we're going to the movies. You mean Stanley's missing? Oh my God! Our son ran away! Die?? Oh God, no! Stanley? Oh, Stanley, where are youuu? Stanley?! Damn it, Stanley, you had us worried sick! You have to get back to the hospital for a shot! Stanley, how are you feeling today, son? The doctor says that maybe you can go home tomorrow. What's so funny, you two? Well, I guess it serves us right. Kids, we should have honest about wanting you to get chicken pox. Randy, my wedding ring! I lost it down the garbage disposal! Stanley, I thought I told you not to watch this horrible cartoon! Here, Stanley, You watch nice cartoons like Fat Abbot. Randy, will you please come get my wedding ring out of the sink! Did you find it? Don't snap at me! You snapped at me! What ever?! In fifteen years you've never said, ""whatever,"" to me! I'm sorry, too. That's not it, you idiot! You just said the C-word! What are you doing sweetheart?! You men are all alike! First you get a cookie and then you criticize the way I dress and then it's the way I cook! I suppose next you'll be telling me that you need your space and that I'm sabotaging your creativity. Go ahead, Stanley. Get your God-damned cookie! Randy, let me handle this. Now Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school. You really should know better, Stanley. Don't interrupt me! You always interrupt me when I talk! Can't you see that I-? There, you did it again!  He interrupted me again. Like you're one to talk! When's the last time you really listened to what I had to say?! Like I'm a ghost. Like he sees right through me. Oh, please yourself! He is. Oh, I'm sorry! I guess I'm wrong again! Stanley, I think you should know that your father has moved out. Because, we're divorced, Stanley. Yeah, kind of. But I would like you to meet your new stepfather, Roy. I'll leave you two alone to get acquainted. Stanley, it's time to go! Your bastard father has visitation rights, and this is his time with you. Come on, Stanley! Stanley, what did you do to Roy?! Stanley, you know you're the most imprtant thing to me, right? Now Stanley, you have to understand how divorce works. When I say, ""you're the most imprtant thign to me,"" what I mean is, you're the most important thing after me and my happiness and my new romances. Bye now. Roy! Stanley?! Your father is coming over for visitation! Stan?  Meet me in the clubhouse. Oh, Randy. What are you doing here? Oh I thought that note was for me. Well, it looks like our little Stanley has built himself quite a clubhouse here. Goodnight. Yes? It's too late for games. Truth. Oh, Randy, I do love you, but- now I'm so confused-uh. I'm living with Roy and-, I don't know how to break it off with him. Maybe. I guess it's my turn. Truth or Dare? Do me. Right here in the clubhouse! Stanley? Look who's here. Aunt Flo. Now, Stanley! Aunt Flo only visits once a month. Be nice. What do you say, Shelley? Okay, Stanley. Your turn. How do you like your fish, Stanley? Oh, now, what's spooky about a cute, little goldfish? Go put him in your room. Yes, you do! Language! Stanley, settle down! Uhno problem, Aunto Flo. There, there, Aunt Flo. Stanley loves his goldfish. Stanley, what are you doing?! Stanley, I'm in no mood for this! Not when youur Aunt Flo is in town! Oh, look, you woke your sister up.  Go to sleep, Stanley! All right, Stanley. I have had enough o-  Oh, Stanley, what have you done, baby? What have you done?? Sshhh. It's okay, honey. It's okay. I've got such a good boy, Mommy's little angel.  Now, don't worry, Stanley. Mommy's going to hide the body.  Nobody's going to take my baby away. I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. D'uh! Aunt Flo, what are you doing up?! Sshh. It's going to be okay, Stanley. Now get some sleep, baby. Mommy's taken care of everything. Sshh. What is it, honey?  My baby's killed again! What are we gonna do, baby? What are we gonna do??  I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. Oh. Uh-Officer Babrady, Woowhat what a surprise. Wwhat can I do for you? Is that so? I'd never seen any of those men, Officer Barbrady. Why would you wanna do that? Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody! Oh, Stanley, no! Not Aunt Flo! Oh, what a good baby. What a good son I have. It's all taken care of, Stanley- G'oh! I've got such a good boy, such a handsom boy! Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny. Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over. Mrs. McCormick, I'm going to have to ask you to leave! You've been drinking! I believe you, sweetheart.  Run from him, boys. Run and don't stop! Yyes, hon? Yes, hon. I had to restrain him so he wouldn't find the bodies in the back yard and take our baby away. Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore. I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again. Oh, dear. It really was Stan's fish that killed those people! I'll leave it up to your father. The answer is no, Stanley! Now go wash up for supper! Go to your room, Stanley! Right now! I just can't believe he would go without our permission! Well, I hope for his sake you're right. Hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother. Did Stanley go up there to Nebraska with you? Wwhat?! Get the car, Randy! We're going to Nebraska! What's going on here?! Is this the Cartman residence? Give me that!  Stnaley! This is your mother! Young man, I have had it! You have disobeyed me for the last time! What do you have to say for yourself, Stanley?! Oh, Stanley. Let's just forget the whole thing and have a nice holiday back home. Stan, you should be excited. I would love to see the rainforest. Besides, your dad and I need some time alone. You have fun, Stanley. Oh, I'll pass. I don't drink hard alcohol. Well, it is kind of a special night. I guess I could... experiment. Oh Mr. Mackey, you nut. Oh, I'm not hot-tubbing. I have nothing to wear. Oh, look at our boys, Sheila.  It's just like they're in college again. Mommy's little boopie-kins Go?? The meteor shower hasn't even started yet. Randy, relax. We don't ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment! Whoopee! Well, I say we go find them and kick their devil-worshipping butts out of town! Yes! We were wrong about you. Will you please play for our Halloween party? Honestly, I don't see what they find so amusing about those things. I'm watching one of Stanley's Chinpokomon video tapes. Our son loves this show, Randy, so I think it's important that we watch it to see if it's teaching him good moral values. I don't know what the hell they're talking about. This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what?! Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff! No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what ""Battle Of The Network Stars"" did to an entire generation. We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because, honestly, we don't know how to feel. You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it. My son hasn't made any sense in days. So, what are we going to do about our children?  Aah, hello-o? Of course! That's a great idea! Stan? Stan, it's Mommy! Stanley,- -you need to come home right now. Mommy misses you. Stanley, I'm talking to you! Stan, please, come home! No it's not okay! What? Can't you see what's happening?! They're just using that talk to distract you! He doesn't really have a small penis! Oh! Wait a minute. Wait a minute, I think I know the answer! I know how to get our kids to stop liking Chinpokomon! Come on! We don't have much time! That's right. Anything we like is instantly not cool.  We know how to take them out, Mr. Garrison! Spread the word! Get on the wire to every parent around the country and tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down! You bet, Stanley! Stanley, honey, what's the matter? Well, that's good, honey. Stanley.  Wake up, honey. It's time to leave for Las Vegas. What should we ask him? Oh, hi, Sheila. Yes. I should have known. It all makes semse now. I could never get Stanley to pay attention when his grandfather told him stories about the '30s. That video had pretty colors. Me too. We were lucky to get tickets. Come on, boys! We're gonna be late. No, Stanley. Cirque du Cheville is French-Canadian. They get acrobats and singers from all over the world and then do very artistic things.. Dad, Stanley needs to see the arts! Come on, everybody, let's go. Oh, look at the funny clown, Stanley. Ooo, these are the contorting quintuplets from Romania. Yes. Too bad it was their last show, or I'd go see it again. Well, of course you can. Come in out of the snow. There's some spare bedrooms upstairs, Mrs....? What should we do, Randy? I like these Romanians fine, but I hope that old woman isn't planning on staying here much longer. Poor dear must be tired. I don't know how to tell. You tell them. Randy! Well, for the time being I, I mean, of course they can stay. Randy, Randy, you'd better have look at this. Well, I... think we... have to,... don't we? We'll have to call the police and see what they want us to do. Oh my God! I didn't know this was going to become such a big deal. Stanley, we have some bad news. The courts have decided the girls must go back to Romania. Oh, Randy, it's gone! It's all gone! You ruined my house! Hello, sweetie. Well, the kids at school made you a card, Kyle. Look. Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People. There's a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named ""Miss Information."" Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say. Wow, that's amazing, Miss Information! Don't be a smartass, Stanley. Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know how to heal the body spiritually. Oh, that's great news! Ooooo. Stanley, what did I say about being a smartass?! Ooh, a tampon made from Cherokee hairü¾³¤¼now that sounds natural. Oh hi, Stanley. Look, I'm buying you some more all-natural toothpaste. That's right. You watch your mouth, Stanley! The Native Americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us! Enough, Stanley! It's okay. We trust that you know whar you're doing. How dare you deceive us like that! Yeah, it looks like Western medicine really did the trick. Did you have fun at Eric's house today, Stanley? What did you do? Oh well, that sounds nice. Oh, he's over at Eric's house practicing for his boy band. Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it. It's a long story, Shelley. Let's just say your father- ...has a lot up his ass right now. Yeah. What? We are not trying to persecute you kids, but you're supposed to be in school. Hi, Sheila. Oh, he's in the back. He set up a video camera so he can tape the performance. I... well... maybe. Oh, Stanley, I wish we could take back all the years of abuse, but we can't. Isn't this a nice Christmas, Stanley? No commercialism and shopping, just a nice fire and family. What a brave little boy. I was really happy with this month's book. I agree with what Bob and Linda said- Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and Daddy's book club night, remember? Later, sweetie.  Anyway, I found myself enticed by Steinbeck's imagery. Oh, wasn't it? I mean, the first sentence: ""Cannery Row in Monterey in California-"" ""-is a poem, a stink, a grating noise..."" It's amazing how with three images he puts you right there, and... Stanley, what the hell are you doing?! STANLEY, YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW! Go, Stanley!  Ahaha, ahem. Heheh, he, he gets very good grades. Stanley, do you know why you're being grounded for ten months? Stanley, don't you understand what you are doing?? You were stimulating the dog, Stanley! What came out of him was his... r-Randy?! Sexual education. Haven't you learned that yet? Oh. Look, well, you see, Stanley,... Well, your school should be teaching this stuff! Look, our kids are learning sexual things on the street and on television. There's no way we can stop it. The schools have to teach them sexual education at a younger age. What the hell was that? Well,I don't know what got into you kids. You should be ashamed of yourselves. This whole mess started because we couldn't talk to our boy ourselves. Are you guys still playing that video game? Eric, put that down! Just go put it back in the trashcan! No that... that came from me; just put it away. Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, it's a personal, woman thing.  I tell you what: If you'll just drop the whole thing right now, I'll buy you that new video game console you've been wanting. Sure. Here you go, boys. Goodnight, boys. Don't stay up too late. Nothing. Come on, Randy. Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now. No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school. No, you're not sick. Now get to school. All of you. Can huh get th'ere 'or me? Weh, that's nahice. Yes. I just saw him. Huh?  Oh. Yeah, it is.  What are they doing here? They can afford to shop at Cherry Creek. Oh dear. Randy... Not bad. Officer Barbrady. What can I do for you? Stole? A-a-are you sure? Not now - my son is not a thief. I'm sure this is just some kind of a misunderstanding. Stanley, did you see-? Stanley, what are you doing with those calves? Stanley, this isn't up for discussion. The rancher is gonna take his cows back and  you don't have a choice!  Stanley! Stanley, you open this door right now or you're gonna get it! Open this door, now! I apologize for this, Mr. rancher person. I can't lie to my son, okay? If I betrayed him like that, I'd pay for it the rest of my life. And so that's the situation. Our boys have locked themselves in Stan's room until we can promosie them the calves will live free, in writing. We excuse me, Sheila, but it wasn't that simple! Yes, I see what you mean, Sheila. That was very impressive. Very persuasive. Alright, Stanley, this has gone on long enough! Your little game is over! Well that's fine! You boys can just stay in there and starve to death. Us parents are going to go to Pizza Shack and have pepperoni pizza and ice cream. You'll have to come out sooner or later, boys. The longer you wait, the more trouble you'll be in. Ms. Cartman, this is a battle of wills. We need our boys to know that we're not gonna cave in, at all. Ms. Cartman, what are you doing? Oh dear God, you've ruined everything. Oh Jesus Christ. You're giving my baby guns? What?? I've heard about other towns bringing in counselors that know how to find things out from kids without really telling them what's going on. That's right, everyone just dig in. So, kids,anything happen with your whole Sunday off? Stanley! I made some quesadillas, if anybody wants some. And if anybody needs to potty, there's a potty basket right here. Randy, could you have a talk with Stanley? It's just that, well, he's been acting a little different lately. He's been ignoring his homework, and, all of his friends. I can't figure out why. Oh yes. Our little Stanley is starting to become a man. I love you. A stranger was caught trying to abduct the Tweek boy. Please, Mr. Tuong Lu Kim. It's a little electrical device that can tell us where you are anywhere on Earth. I wouldn't worry about that. Congratulations on your victory, boys. Turn it up. Stanley, time for us to get back to the house. NOW, Stanley! Right. Do what you normally would do. Good-bye, son.  Remember to eat right. Oh, it's just... I was wondering if Stan's okay. Do you really think we did the right thing, Randy? Sending all the young kids in town to live on their own? I know. My son has become a Mongolian?? No! Noooo!! Oh... oh, that's so sweet. You have to understand that Kenny's body isn't up in the clouds. He was cremated. Randy! Gerald! We, we were wrong about heaven! The Japanese just reached it with their ladder! See for yourself! Do you really think this is a good idea, Randy? Ooo, you're a little frisky, aren't you? Oho, you little devil. Hey there, cowboy. You bet I am! Mmm, sounds good. Mm, yeah baby. Ready? Wow, the production values are really good in this porno. But then that means...! Oh my God, this is gonna be so embarassing. ""Hi Chris, Hi Linda. We were just wondering if we could get our porno back."" The boys! Awgh, I gues we have to go talk to 'em now. Oh dear! Oh no. We're sorry. Boys? Look! There's one of the boys now! Jimmy! See boys, a woman is sensitive in her vagina and it... feels good to have a man's penis inside of it. How was school? Yeah, but Dad- Go ahead and kill yourself, stupid tar-breath! That sounds good to me. Oh Randy, I'm so ashamed of our son. Stan, what did I tell you about watching The Osbournes? It's going to make you retarded! Who are you? Randy, what's going on? But why are you back in this time with us, son? That's right. We're a family no matter what time shift. You must be exhausted. Why don't you get some sleep? Well I'm sure Stan wouldn't mind his room, would you, Stan? It's just a little weird having people lying to our boy like this. Well that makes sense. Uh, Stan,  don't you think you're upsetting your future self a little? Yeah, he must be.  It's like, I jsut feel he's our son, you know? Right. S-stanley you don't need to do that. He-he is your future self. Randy! Looks like you'd better really watch out for marijuana, huh Stan? Yes, well, eh you see, son, the time matrix pulled in more people from the future. He's right. If we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs, then they're never gonna believe anything we tell them Well here, Eric, I baked you a huge box of cookies as a present. Boys! You were supposed to come out here and tell everyone about the Founding Fathers! Yeah. Come on, Sheila, let's go to the nickle slots. What's wrong with Gerald? What?? But don't the Native Americans know he has nowhere else to go? Oh hi Gerald, Sheila. Sure. Come on in. The guys are all watching TV. Don't our men look Well sure, Sheila. Our husbands are all so clean and neat. My Randy irons his clothes and even has pedicures. And how about our boys, huh? Ever since gay culture became cool, our boys bathe every night and brush their teeth three times a day. This is the greatest thing ever. You know, I'm starting to think this whole metrosexual thing isn't so great. Oh, stop it! Will you all just stop it?!  Look, you guys are carrying this fad too far! Will you please stop acting this way?! This is crazy! That does it! I can't take it anymore! Ladies, get yoru things! I know what we have to do! There they are! Get 'em! We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice. You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat. We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier. But it doesn't. Oooh, hi Dad. He's not here, hun. He's having a meeting with all the seniors in town at the community center. Every senior in town will be driving home... Oh, hi Stan. Well, Stan, God and Jesus don't actually speak to people. Where are you going? Randy, don't cause trouble. What are you talking about? Stanley, what did you do this time?! No, it can't be! My son is not a filthy smoker! Here, Stanley, I made your favorite potato dish. I want you to feel better, okay. Oh. Stan got served at school today. Let's not make a big deal out of it. That was the right thing to do. Well, nice going, Randy! Really great advice you gave our son here! Those kids showed up to serve Stan again and he danced back! It's on! Randy?  Randy, oh my God! Oh, are they nice people? Well, we're supposed to have the Broflovskis and the Stotches over for dinner tonight. Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too. ...They are fun.  Boys, you okay out there? Boys, I do not want you going over to Mr. Jefferson's anymore. Do you understand? There you go. All set, sweetie? I'm sure a lot of people do, hon. It's pretty exciting, isn't it? Now, you just get some sleep.  You've had a busy day.  Goodnight, sweetie. Stanley, it's almost eight o'clock. Where have you been? Oh yes, the laundry machine is down in the basement and our son is home. Could you please set the table for dinner? What?? Who taught you to talk like that?! That's right! We're not raising our son to be an ignorant timecist. You know, a racist, but against people from the- How was school today, Stanley? ...What did you say? Stanley, do you know how many people died so you could have the right to vote?! Well, hold on, Randy, I think a turd sandwich is a little better than them having a giant douche on their uniforms. It's sexist is what it is! Are you calling me ignorant?? I am sick of you belittling my opinion, you son of a bitch! You see? He's out of control. It's nearly torn our whole family apart. Oh, Randy! Stan, you came back. Does that mean... you learned the importance of voting? You can't judge the merits of voting on whether or not your candidate won. Yes. Wall*Mart is the leading employer of seniors. And they also employ the handicapped. Why yes I'd love one, Jimmy. Randy, what are you doing? It's almost midnight. Here we go, everyone. I got three nice steaks from South Park Grocery. We'll have to share them. We do? Stan, sweetie, we're gonna go to the mall. Do you wanna come? Okay, sweetie. He went with his friends to that music festival. Now, Randy, we were the same way once, too. Don't forget that we were both considered hippies back in the '60s. You ate too much acid, man! ...Oh my God. Our son is with those people. Please, save our boy, Randy. Randy, sit down. Randy, don't! Randy... What? Why? You don't think you can?! This is the biggest game of your son's life! Wny wouldn't you go and support him? What-? So then, don't. You don't have to get in fights with other parents at Little League games! Just sit there and watch! No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown out of games and make an ass of yourself. Get up, Randy! Fight! Fight for me! Hi boys. Uuh uh uh, not so fast. You boys can help bring in the other groceries in the car, then have your chicken. It won't take a minute."
"RANDY","Damn it, stop.  Oh!  Damm it! How do we get our runaway children back? Hello, Stanley. It's me, Poppa.  Gosh, your mother and I miss ya. And I hope thatü¾ ¼ wherever you may be, you'll hear this message. Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully-ee sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickien pox so that he would get it early. Yeah, it's it's true, he is. We're going down to-uuh Happy Burger for some milkshakes. See ya, son. Doctor? Wuhwhere's Stan? Stan, our son? Will he be okay, out of the hospital? Okay, well well, let's go look! I'ma I'm sure he couldn't have gone far. Stan? Stan? Stanley, where the hell have you been? Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital. What? Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley? I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals! Uh oh! No, I was just uh flipping through the channels Okay Uhyou just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something? How do you think I met your mother? Oh, brother. Yeah, Stanley, you should know better. Okay, okay. Give me a second, would you?! I didn't snap at you. Whatever. Nuh- I don't wanna fight. I'm sorry. Uh I think I found it. Hey, back off, cunt! Did I? Stanley, I-! Skylarkings? Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school. You need to shape up, mister! I don't interrupt you. Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation! When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap! Welluh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say. Oh, please! No, she is. Hey, Stanley, uuh, hop in.  Listen, Stanley, I I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your- your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up. Well, hello, ladies. I'm already there.  What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more. Well, no, because you're a family! You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what. Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it.  Well, anyway, have a nice day. Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out. You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan? Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party. Iii-uuh got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse. Oh, maybe it was. I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse. Sharon? Truth or Dare? No, I'm serious, please. Truth or Dare? Do you still love me? Well, you never know. Maybe- -thing will work out. Dare. Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning. Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity. Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. Hey, why is the basement door locked? Sharon? There's a policeman being held captive in our basement. Why'd you take his pants off?  Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off? What is it? Oh. Wuwell, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick? I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore. Eh, it's fine with me. Now, Sharon, don't overreact. Maybe Stan didn't go to Cartman's Grandmaother's. Maybe he just ran away or got kidnapped or something. Sure. We'll punish you after the holidays. ...Uuuh. Mayor, I'm a geologist. Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth. Wow. Or else what? Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no. Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else. Exactly. Right. It's in the attic with the old LP's. Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing? New girlfriend? Maybe nothing...  maybe everything. Yes, yes, of course. I've got work to do.  What?! All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him. Now, walk.  Do you feel hot? Damn it! How come you're not combusting? No! Has she been doing anything odd? Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend. No! I think I might have it. Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust. Uh, it's too complicated to explain over the phone. Wow. The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her.  You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas.  The methane gathers here in the bowel area , where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart.  Should the gas not be expelled,  the methane can build up and then ignite,  leading to... disaster.  Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long. Exactly. I am? I am, huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now. Whoa hoho, whoa!  Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah! You wanted to see me, Mayor? I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave. Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems. Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent. Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly. Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed.  Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up? Stan? Awww crap. Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere. Hey! Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution. Mr. Garrison, help me! Ije, I I don't know what to say. Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me. Hm. Really? Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me. What? You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right.  Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book. All right. Now, let's get to work. Wow! ...Right, right right. Uh. Please, everyone- Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer. It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny. I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want.  Ow. No problem, Jakov. Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels? Jakovasaurs don't wear clothes, Jakov. Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time. Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it. Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him. Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time. We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan. One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little. Yeah, experiment. Hell, we should get in. I'm getting in for a while, too.  Geronimo! Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh? I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things. Good idea. Hohn.  Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me. Huh? Oh, you mean, this? Yeah. That, that was me. Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot. O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that. With two girls or two guys? You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have. No, I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they? Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it? ...Well it is a night for experimenting. Okay, I'll start. ...Yeah. No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right? Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing. Um... Yeah yeah sure sure. Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay? Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself. Oh he, he lives in, like, Florida. Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips. Okay. I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub. I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody. Well, of course we wouldn't. Yuh... You didn't ...tell anybody, did you? What?! Why the hell would you do that?! Well, of course! I thought it would be implied! When you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub, you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody! AAAW!! Who?! Who who did you hear is, is gay?! Oh. What the hell is that supposed to mean?! Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now? There's nothing to talk about. No, I-... I don't know. No! Will you stop it?! I don't... I just... Aaww!  Sharon?  Sharon, cuh can we go? Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now. Ogh, I already did. Not now, Stanley. Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone? We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay! God, everybody's looking at me. Everybody knows. What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-! It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry! All we did was watch each other masturbate in the hot tub! Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares!  We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is! You mean it? I'm not gay? Oh, I feel so much better! Wow! Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay! Lynch mob! Here's their van! Here's their van! KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us! What are you doing? Why? ...Are those good moral values? I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all. Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent. My God, you're right. Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys. Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is! Well, I guess that settles that. Chinpoko ga dai-suki yoo! Uh we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1! Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker. Isn't that cool? Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves. Well, I'm sure glad this is all over. Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store Uh, look, Mr.... Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own. Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once. Uhwhy do we want to all chaperone the dance? Alright, alright, that's enough, boys. Let's bring those Confederate bastards down! Alright men, fire! Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down. Yeh-hah! He took the bell! Ow! That hurt! Oh? Jimbo, have you lost your mind?! Alright, alright. We surrender. Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment. All I'm saying is that... is is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka! Huh? Well, the Union be damned! Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?! WHERE?! Come on, boys! Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging.  Get over here! We're out of s'more schnapps? Oh, my head. Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us. Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here. Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff. Ey, that sounds fun. What was that?? A whole year? Yeah, with our own eyes. We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?! That's God? Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it. Wasn't that great, son? You didn't know that was gonna happen, did you, Stanley? You're from Cirque du Cheville. Well... Ew, Dad! Not in front of Stanley! Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping. Huh? Alright, we've gotta figure out what to do. I'm gonna go wake her up.  Hello? Mrs.... Mrs., Old Romanina Woman?  Ma'am? No, Dad. No, Dad, she's dead! It looks like she had a heart attack. ...Ew! Uh, girls, we... have some bad news. Um...  Everyone who has a grandma, step forward.  Uh, not so fast, girls. Well, Stan, it's not really our- What? Uh-oh. I don't know. That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold. Stan, we- I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls. Oh, shi- Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag. No, it does not sound nice!  Stanley, you are gonna have no part in that boy band! If all your friends jumped off a cliff, would you do that too? YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE IN A BOY BAND, STANLEY! AND THAT IS FINAL! Where is Stan? What?! I specifically told him not to do that! And what if they do make it, Sharon?! What if they DO make itü¾³¤¼are YOU gonna be the one to tell 'im?! Stanely, what the hell are you doing? You get in the truck right now! GET IN THE TRUCK! Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be warching TV or, laying in bed. Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do! Have you ever tried marijuana? Well, maybe it's time. Because I said so! Let 'em be pissed off, then! NOOO!!  NOOO!! ...I was- ...I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store.in Denver. I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience. Uh sure. Ohh, thanks. What? Me? Do you like my singing that much? Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I- No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it. And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school... See ya. ...I said good-bye to my girlfriend... See ya. ...And I left my family. See ya. And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know. It's obvious to me. The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world. Now, give it to me, 'cause- I had everything. A huge house,  and all the women you can imagine.  And then one day, just as quick as it started... Hey, Mr. Allens Who are they But, w-we're still selling records, right? I'm 19. They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car... ...the women all left... ...and they took back my house Ugh. The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned. And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about. I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, ""No!"" Because all the fame and the money, the womenü¾³¤¼all it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world.  That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley.  It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then ssspitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops! Now we wander the earth in disarrayü¾³¤¼us, New Kids On The Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And THAT... is why you can't go to the mall! Huh? Yeah? Come here, Stanley.  Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes. You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid? Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall. Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this. Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little. Well, that was quite an uplifting sermon. Oh, now look at that. They're scared to death. Oh, what the hell are they doing now?! Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both. Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child. That is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Becuase it's what makes our country work! Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news? Yeah. Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show. Shipped. He said ""shipped."" Ng-aah, that word's kind of getting old. It's not really... funny anymore. Really? So we can't say __g? ...Hey, you didn't get beeped. I, I can't follow this shitty storyline at all. That makes sense. Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years. Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine. You're the new scout leader? Well he got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone. So he's a homosexual. So what? Aw, that's ridiculous. Come on, Stanley. Come on, Stan. What did you say?! YOU DO NOT SAY ""BIG SILLY GOOSE!!"" You call him an asshole like a normal kid!! STANLEY, YOU CALL YOUR FRIEND AN ASSHOLE THIS INSTANT!!! That's better! Nice to meet you. Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape. You bet. See ya, Mr. Grazier. Oh, no. Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off. Oh my God. Well, we'va all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too. WAAAH! Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company!  Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever! No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual. Well, you know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... stuff come out.  Well, Jesus, haven't they taught you these things at school?! Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone! What? Hey, Sharon? Maybe you should stop watchin' the news for a little bit? Shu- Sharon, you've been watching CNN for about ah... eight weeks now. Don't you wanna watch somethin' else?  Shu-shu-sharon? Stanely, your mother's a little freaked out right now. Why don't you go play with your big brown package from Afghanistan outside? Hey, Sh- Sharon? Ha- have you seen Stan in the last couple... days? Oh okay. I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't see it.  But I want one. Oh, man, it that the IT? Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works. Well,  it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle. Well... so... they don't really... do anything. So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth? Hey, uh, Sharon? Isn't that the Williamses? They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th that means he's going to be going to heaven soon. Here he comes! Yeah! That has got to be about the biggest misunderstanding EVER!! Well don't you see what this means? It's been 22.3 years, so... AIDS is finally funny! Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void. They let you stay for free? Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend. Oh, do we have to do it right now? Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal. So then it's not really ours. Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now? Wait... All right, look, we've been here for over three hours No, nononono. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay. Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are. Well, this certainly is nice. Oh, God-damnit! No, we dont want the super-secret fun prize alright?! We just wanna ski!! Come on, everybody!! Don't listen to 'em, let's just go! Let's just get out of here. Alll the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and, and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave! Oh, Jesus. Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year! Stanley, they belong to him. Stan, you're behaving like a kid! Well we tried everything. We can't get through the door without tearing apart the house. We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers! What is that? What? Jesus Christ! Vaginitis? A Catholic boat trip? Waaah! Waaah!  Uyah  ahem. 'Scuse me. Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests. With everything that's been in the news, I think it's best to keep our kids... far away from the priests. It couldn't hurt. You know, I think we've just had it with the Church. All the horrible things they've done to kids, I... I think I'm gonna become an atheist! Well uh, let's, let's just be atheists. Yeah! Stan, you're an atheist now! Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food. Noho, it doesn't work that way, son. No it doesn't. Honey! Honey, come quick! Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great time bein' atheist. I for one can't believe I used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say. That's right, I agree.  And it should be taken off of money as well.  The religious right in this country is trying to force our children to believe what they bel-  Bwwaaaagh  And we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids. Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down! He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes Why? What's the matter with him? Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts. Hey there, son. Yes, ahta. Let's have a talk, Stan. Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these ""ahta"" will start becoming a major part of your life. But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever. I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday, you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most. If you can just understand that, Stanley, you'll see that boobs hold no real power at all. Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! We have to stop these abductors from being able to get into our town! Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in. Your ancestors put up a great wall that kept Mongolians out for thousands of years. We know you can do it for us. Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker. If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters. There, I think that's got it. You can barely even tell you have one on. There is no other team. Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us. Yeah, and you kicked ass! Here you go, Stanley. This should hold you over for three years. The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you. We can't tell you because we can't know where you are! Good-bye, kids. We'll... never forget you. What's the matter? Oh, I'm sure he's made it somewhere safe by now. Sweetheart, you saw the news... Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe, off in a whole new city by now, making a new life for themselves. What's going on? What the hell are they doin' here?! Rabble! Rabble rabble! Wait wait. I learned some Mongolian in college.  Ah, let's see. Uh. K-kids, uh, Bi kute. Bi salnek kute. Uh-d tah tasobarro. Bi kute. Staaan. Your name... is Staaan! That's it! Remember, son! Rememmmber! No, no. You know who was right all along? The Mongolians.  They knew that you just can't wall yourself off from the outside world. Putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together. Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor. A ladder to heaven? Why, son? That's the ...s-s-saddest thing I've ever heard. The boys wanna see their dead friend Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building a ladder to heaven. No, it's... alright, Sheila. The boys were just... building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend, Kenny. No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this has gone on far enough. Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but... When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes. The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is. What? Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven. If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons. Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy?? No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it. Uh, boys,  Butters' parents want to borrow the Lord of the Rings video we rented. Could you take it over to them? Yeah, whatever. Hmmm, that gets rid of them. Yeah, well uh, the Lord of the Rings wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store.  I also rented... a porno. Youuu wanna go watch? You ready for some hot, steamy fun? The guys at the office told me I had to rent this porno. They said ""this is without a doubt thee hottest porno ever made."" I love that lingerie.  Yeah. You like that? Yeeaahhh.  Alright, you ready? Oh yeah. Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have a story. Oh yeah. Yeah, it almost looks like... the Lord of the...  OH MY GOD! > This is Lord of the Rings!! The boys have the hottest porno ever made! Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet. Boys! Boys!  Where's the videotape? Wellll, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast? Yes, it is. It is more important than anything I've ever asked you to do. You must retrieve the tape. But do not look at it, uh, for it ...holds an evil power! Retrieve the tape, and return it to us at home.  Do this, and you will be greatly rewarded. Okay, problem solved. Uh Chris, are the boys over here? We...  well, this is really sort of funny, but uh, we, we accidently put a... porno in the Lord of the Rings box. The boys must've come and saw what it was and... then taken it away somewhere. And so that's the situation. All the boys are out there somewhere with a... pornographic videotape. I'm a...fraid it was... Back Door Sluts 9. It it can't hurt 'em that much, can it? We think our boys might be showing other chiildren a, uh, ...pornographic tape. Yes, uh... you see, Token... that was called a pornographic film uh, ih it shows adult men and adult women having sexual intercourse.  Well, ya, you see, when a, when a man and a woman fall in love, the the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina. It's called love-making, and it's part of being in love. Jimmy! Jimmy!  Where did the boys go with the porno tape?? The video sandwich? What's a video stockyard, Jimmy? I know where it is! Boys! Boys! There you are! A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths.  Uh this is called ""sixty-nining"" and it's normal. That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting. Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it. Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage. Aw I'm surprised at you, Stanley. I really thought you knew how to accept people for what they were. No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators! Ah, here's the Arab as a terrorist. Ah, here's a good one.  It's the stereotypical ""sleepy Mexican."" Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture. That's our Cartman. Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys? Well I really thought you boys really learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers! Oh my God. He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way this asshole was acting. We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top? Who is it, Sharon? Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police! Okay, we've had enough! I don't know. How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future. Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you. I think he's pretty scared alright. Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us. Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself. Oh. You. You don't? Well, you know what I think, Stan? I think he IS from the future. Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol. Oh, Stan! Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself? Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh? Don't be silly, Stan. You don't wanna go through life without one of your hands. Stan... Uh... nothing. Go ahead. AAAHHH! Oh my God! Look!  What? His hand did disappear! He is you from the future! Uh..  Look, it was fake in the future, too. Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too. Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are. Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but... Well son, pot makes yuu feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything. Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.! You really did a nice job, Eric. Christmas is ruined again! Stan! Oh, what a fighter. The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest! How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?! He's right.  Boy, do I feel like a fool. Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square. Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music prowar proopaganda! Oh, you think so? Bring the shizzle! Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song. The boys are going to give a presentation at our rally about how the Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest! Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side. Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song! Well I'm a little bit rock-n-roll! And I'm a little for bringin' them home. No, but war shouldn't be our goal. If it means war, then we say NO! I like to rock, but I don't wanna rock Iraq! Why are we fightin' this war? For you people who still think war is the answer, perhaps you can listen to the voices ... of the children. He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another. And I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-eh And me, I'll be the caring soul. Come on up here, everybody! Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes. Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans, remember? Show some respect. All right, time to win some money! Oooo, the nickle slots! You might win the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women, huh? God I hate 'em. How's it goin', Gerald? Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks. Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars?? Gerald, twenty-six thousand-! Where did you get that kind of money?? Just six quarters! He... he lost his house to the Native Americans. They don't care. But how can they do that?! No, screw that! We'll just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves! How much do we have to raise, Mayor? Ohhh, never mind. How can you do this to people? There's more to life than profits! Well like, you know, Slurpees and stuff. Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow. Yeah.  But it's the only shot we've got to save our town. All right, boys. You're gonna have to wait here. It's in God's hand now.  Stand aside, everyone! We're gonna try and beat you at your own game, Chief Runs With Premise! Ten thousand dollars!  On thirty one black! Oh hell yeah! Let it ride! Damnit! Stan? Okay? You just don't understand the fine points of gambling. You're never supposed to stop when you're on a winning streak. Stan? Okay? All right? Stan? Okay? Hey, mister!! We're not like them, all right?!  Now, we may have pie in the sky dreams once in a while, but we aren't the ones kicking people out of their homes! So don't you compare us to those cold-hearted, money-grubbing, evil stinky Indians!  I'm sorry, Native Americans. Stanley, we don't have a choice. The Native Americans own South Park now. We have to take what they'll give us for our homes. It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move to the next town over. We can stand here as long as it takes. What do they want? You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you. Well, thanks. How's your... mother? It's cool on my tongue. Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS. There's only a ninety-eight percent chance that I will live. Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us.  Soon there will be only ninety-eight percent of us left. You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people. The spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellocreek. Now go. GO! Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision?? Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone! We have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture. We're a simple people. All we want is to be allowed to live our lives. Heeey Geraaald! How are youuuu!! Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual. It's super-fabulous. Would you like some shirazz? Mr. Garrison!  Hey doll. You're looking ultra-fabulous. Nuno, thanks, I'm, I'm not like that. Well, we don't ""pound butt,"" Mr. Garrison, we're straight. Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men!  Hey guys! There's a sale in Express for Men! Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting about? What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about. Oh really?! Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare. Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic! Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you! Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets! Oh my God, it's on fire! I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants! Put it out! Put it out! Fire! Hey eses. Stan, are you okay? Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths. Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not that big a deal. Well, Stan, it's a very fragile issue. Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away. Yes Dad. Yes I know. Sharon, have you seen Dad? Oh.  Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out... At the same time.  Oh My God! Get inside! Get inside!  Seniors' meeting getting out! Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving!  Gerald! Where are the boys?! The boys, Gerald! Where are they?! Oh My God!! GET OFF THE STREETS!  GET OFF THE STREETS! GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS! GET OFF... GET STRAIGHT OFF THE STREET! -STREETS!! OFF- GAAAAAH!! Come on! Get over there! Stay low! Shhhh!  It's okay, boys. They're gone. Let's just lay low for a minute until we can find-  AWWWW!! RUN! Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!! In here! Quiet! Keep quiet! Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay the night in here. We'll stay the whole winter if we have to. Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go. Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now! You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?! We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm?  Who's the sorry-sorry? Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did! What the hell is going on?! Dad, what are you doing?? This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before morp people get hurt> Stan! Boys! You're safe! They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake! Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them! No, son. We... like to sleep in. They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!!  Boys, avenger me! AVENGER ME!! Whoa-ho-ho-ooh, what happened? Is it over? Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does. Huh? Who? Who are the Harrisons? Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?! We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger. All right, that does it! I'm gonna go have a talk with this ""Mr. Harrison.""  If he thinks he can fill my son's head with wacko religious crap, he's wrong! Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass!  This, Mr. Garrison is, is a white guy, right? Jyeah, I'm gonna go kick his ass! God-damned religious kooks! Tell my son what to believe, will you?! We'll see how you like my fist in your ass! Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison? Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a- Uh, look, I just want to tell you that Well, thanks. Uh... Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son. You know. About... God, and stuff. Well, I- Well, no, no, I just- Y-you can call me... Randy. Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honist, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem? Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night. Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America? Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion. All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon! One two three four. ""Pay one thousand dollars property tax.""  Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening. We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening! And?  Your turn, Sharon. Yes. Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelley. Oooo, that must be the Harrisons! Well, come on in and sit down, everybody. You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion. Ooo, what's that? Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion. Yeah! Smoke you know has got to go. You go, you got to know to say the ""no"" to the smoke, you go go..  ... you gotta get it! What about emphysema?? Is that cool?? Pfft! That's none's the cool. Yeah, because if you don't smoke, you can grow up to be- I don't have a son! Well, those God-damned tobacco companies aren't gonna have control over MY kid! I say we bring them down! What? Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. Your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies. Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right. Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway? This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters! What happened to him? What's the matter with him? You got served? By who? So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back? What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it?? Naw, that's crap, Sharon! Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak. Well then, it's about time you learned! Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage! Now! All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye, and give 'em this.  Come on, Stan. ...six, seven, eight. What? So what happened? Uh ex, excuse me. Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm I'm Stan Marsh's father. Uh, listen. Ih, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... Weh well look I, I just came down here to tell you... Ih it's not on. Nonono, it's not on. It isn't on. Nothing's on. It's off. I'm keeping my son home on Saturday. I just came by to let you know so you can... put a stup to all this. Good bye. Aw, mph! Uuuugh-ah. His dancing was so fast I ...couldn't do anything. His moves were... so original, so inventive.  Ungh! Grrgh. Stan?? Stan?? Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me. But I know I can't stop you from doing it. So all I can say is... give 'em hell, son. Give 'em hell. Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon. I heard people saying you all were from Illinois. ....Yeeeah. Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent? Stan, time to get up for school.  Stan? What the-?  Mr. Jefferson?! Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate! Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting. We know, Stanley. We've been watching. That's our new housekeeper, Mrs.  Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  And she'll do it for ten cents an hour. Oh my God!  Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?! They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do. Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is! All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking. Stan Marsh! Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth!  You just sit right there, Stanley, and you thnk about what you've done! Hey, Mr. Nelson. Why? This is my office. What? You can't be serious. Oh my God. They took my jarb!! We're doing the only thing we can do. If our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come, then we have to take matters into our own hands.  We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there are no future humans! Present-day America Number One! All we can do is try, Harrison. Well what are we waiting for? Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous? You don't see the point!! Oh you young people just make me sick! You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?! You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean! You don't understand the issues, Sharon! You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein! Stanley, when you left for school this morning, you said you were going to vote! Ogh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just got yourself suspended! Expulsion?? Our son, banished. Where did we go wrong?? This is breaking your mother's heart, Stan. She couldn't even help tie you to the horse. Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is.  Goodbye, Stan. That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do. So who won, Mr. Mackey? Stan! He's going to vote!! Hey! That's not true, Stan. Your vote still mattered. Look at it, honey. It's so big. It's beautiful! Just look at the Marsh family, huh? Brand-new television, new plastic dishware and cups, and enough bulk-buy ramen to last us a thousand winters. It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all, but, God I love it. AAAH!  Yeaaah... Anu-nothing!  I'ma I'ma, I'm just gonna head down to the Wall*Mart real quick. Yeah, think about it. If I go there now, there won't be anybody else there. I can all the bargains to myself! So-o-o-o-on? Son... No, I'm just... really really tired. I... was shopping at Wall*Mart all night. Checkout line... They had these... little stickers filled with glitter! They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them. I couldn't resist! Do you want one? Here. It's a little turtle. We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs. We'd all like you... out of South Park. Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled. Eh, I remember when we could afford to buy six steaks when we shopped at Wall*Mart. I know, I KNOW! GOD!!  BLEHH! Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall*Mart! Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall*Mart! Stan! One family buying one glass isn't gonna make a difference! Hey...  Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't going to shop at the Wall*Mart anymore! Mr. Garrison! Chef! Jimbo!  Now, come on people! What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't you see what you're all doing?! I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here. Oh all right, em maybe I was gonna buy a glass. One glass! ... And some chips... And butter.  And some new pliers. Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist! We have to find a way to put the South Park Wall*Mart out of business once and for all! Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. You get a discount working here. Ten percent. That means the bargains are even better. I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall*Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend. Boys, these axes are only four ninety-nine. Shhhhh! What are you talking about? Television department... All right, come on, let's go!  Oh my God! Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall*Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us! Gaaahh! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains! The screwdrivier set is only nine ninety-eight! I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me! This bargain is too great for me! I'm gonna have to buy these! Here! Take the keys and go on!  The television department is near the back! Next to the cell phones! Go! Hurry! I'm gonna go buy these screwdrivers! Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff! Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall*Mart... is us. You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand? Oh no she di'int. Believe what? What are you talking about? Sharon, have, have you seen Stan? Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?! Yeah, but when we did it we actually stood for something. I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something there. S-stan. STAAAN! Stan?! Stan?! I need to get through, please! My son is in there! Duh-uh!  Stan?! Stan! Stan! Sta-ogh. Ugh! Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now? Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should've listened to you earlier. We're just asking you to try. The whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake. It's yours. My God... I'm the... only scientist in town. You got a better ides, Steven?! Damnit, my son is in there! Check. Vehicle shell holding! The drill is getting too hot from all the hippies. Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters. Which cord is it? I'm a geologist! Nyugh! It's working! It's, it's working! Stan! Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter heydn no hit no hit can't hit can't hit can't hit it can't hit it can't hit it. Good call, ref! Good call! What'd you say?! You want me to kick your ass right here?! Whattaya wanna do, huh? Whattaya wanna do? I'm standin' right here! How do you wanna handle it? This is for what?! Arresting me for what?! I'm not allowed to stand up for myself?! I thought this was America! Huh?! Isn't this America!? I'm sorry, I thought this was America! Heeey! Well somebody had to put that knucklehead in his place. Wha-what do you mean? I can fight anybody. I just need to train. I just need to get in the best shape of my life. Oh boy, they're really gettin' into each others' heads out there.  Yeah! Let's go, South Park! These Fort Collins kids got nothin'! Wooo! Guess that's my guy. I can take him, no problem. Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter batteruuuuuuuupp batterbatterbatterbatter! Yeah! Attaway, South Park! They ain't swingin' at nothin'! Walk to first! Woo! Fort Collins can't play! Come on, let's go! I'm right here! Oh I'm sorry! Why don'tcha get 'im on chars in America, I'm sorry! Greeley sucks! Greeley sucks! What, is this a Communist country or something?! I thought this was America! ü¾¼Pueblo, no bueno! ü¾¼Pueblo es muy mal! This is America! This is an honest America! Can you believe it, Stan? State Championship game. It's... the greatest thing ever. I've worked hard, believed in myself, and now I'm gonna be fighting in a State Championship game.  This is gonna be the biggest fight of my life. They've worked really hard to get here, Chris, and, you know, I don't like to really ""trash-talk,"" but, I don't think Denver has a chance. Well I think that there's a uh... Oh my God. ...I'm not gonna go. Stan's little league game, I'm... I'm not gonna go. I just... don't think I can, all right? Because I'm scared, all right?!  You wanna break me down?! You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared! I don't know if I believe in myself anymore.  I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon. Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I have to fight him because it's who I am. I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone. It's over, Denver! South Park whupped your ass! What do you wanna do, huh? Hey Bat Dad!  I didn't hear no bell."

"THE MAYOR","Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a great week for South Park. Miss Hermans has opened the east wing of the library, and our own South Park Cows Elementary School dodgeball team is going to the national finals!  Where they will undoubtably be beaten senseless by the Washington team.  But most importantly, this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease. Conjoined Twin Myslexia. And so it is in honor of this that I declare this exciting week as Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week!  And now, let's kick off our weeklong festivities with the first Annual Grand Conjoined Parade!  Let's hear it for these brave souls!  What a glorious parade that was! Let's hear it for the parade coordinators! Nonsense. This is your week. You aren't going anywhere. And so, at this honorary dinner we take a look back at our beloved Nurse Gollum and the brave life she has lived. Roll the tape, please, Mr. Garrison. Hand now, friends, hit's time to present the Lifetime Conjoined Twin Achievement Award. This award goes to outstanding conjoined twins who have made a mark on society. And the winner is Nurse Gollum!! Ladies and gentlemen, on this fourth day of Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week, all our prayers are with our little South Park Cows now playing their hearts out in China.  Now, join me in saluting our Cows and help make Nurse Gollum not feel like an outcast with our first official Conjoined Twin Myslexia Hat! And now, let's hear from the woman of the week, the incredible, courageous, Nurse Gollum! Uuhh. Freaks with big hearts! And now, le- Wow, this is gonna put a damper on the day.  Let's have ice cream, everyone! This is absurd. We need fireworks for our Fourth of July celebration at the lake.  I don't care that some twerp blew his hands off! We've got to have fireworks for our picnic! Hold on, I've got another call.  Hello? No, I don't know where Mr. Hat is. Jesus, Garrison, I've got bigger problems!  Hello, yes? Now what am I supposed to do about our Fourth of July show at the lake? NO, I don't want snakes! This is an outrage! Get me the Mayor! I know that, smartass, I was being ironic! Well, keep looking! This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes? Wait a minute, that's it! I've got it. This year, South Park will make history by having the largest snake in the world! The press will love it. I'll be on the front peh-  Oooooogh. Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake! Ooooo! ü¾ ¼Comanche helicoptersü¾ ¼ ü¾ ¼flamethrowersü¾ ¼triggered at the same timeü¾ ¼ Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever. Wait a minute! We're gonna need an orchestra to play the Stars and Stripes! Yyes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus! Of course I do, you fuckin' asshole! Where the hell is our firework! We only have 24 hours. Shut up! Call everybody! The show's back on! Come on! We've only got one day to prepare! Ladies and Gentlemen, good citizens of Colorado. It's my pleasure to be the first person to wish you all a Happy Fourth of July! Let's start with our school band playing the Stars and Stripes! What the fuck is that?! Oh, hell!  Light the smake! My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity.  Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out? Yes. You know, expire, end.  Hello, I'm asking you when it stops! What?! Oh my God!  You tell me how much longer this thing is gonna last!! So when does it run out?! Oh, hell! A yeh-a yes. Apparently, my plan too- blow up the snake wworked perfectly. Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to kick off the 14th Annual South Park Cow Days!  As most of you know, Cow Days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble, gentle cows.  And now, the chairman of Cow Days, Jimbo Kern! Now get out to the carnival and enjoy the amazing rides and the wonderful games! You found it! You found the memorial! And the cows? Are they all back, too? What?! Well, perhaps, one day, cows will learn that cults are never a good thing. Sounds like somebody declared Shenanigans! Didn't we ever release them? Oh my God! Officer Barbrady, ugh, you never had Tom and Mary in this cell. No, no. In fact, they never came to South Park. We've never heard of them. Ohoho, that was wonderful, Chef. Good show! Ugh, come on, buck up, little fella. Sure you are, Chef. I'll give you a hundred more for another romp!  Aw, hell! And the winner is: Squash-O-Lantern, by Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and the evil Eric Cartman from the parallel universe! You boys win the Halloween Chocolate Ball! Oh, what now?! The people are panicking about spontaneous combustion. That's why I've assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon. You are the best scientific mind South Park has to offer. Right. Look, you're the only scientist that lives in this town. You have to find an answer before more people combust. You do that, and you'll be the most beloved man in South Park. Marsh, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Find the cause of spontaneous combustion, or else! Exactly! Mayor. Why? Okay. If you're right about this, Marsh, you're going to be the most popular man in South Park. Shmuck! All right, people. Scientist Marsh and I have been working very hard on the problem of spontaneous combustion, and we have finally come up with a solution. Mr. Marsh? So, from this day forward, everyone in South Park will be required to fart on a regular basis to insure that nobody else spontaneously explodes. And so I declare today Randy Marsh Day, where we shall remember forever how he freed us all from the threat of spontaneous combustion. Gentlemen? My God, it's burning up in here! Can't we crank the AC up some more? Yes, Marsh. We have a new problem, and I think only you can solve it. Yes. The temperature is steadily rising every day. I want you to find out why. All right, all right. Name your price. Done. Just find out what's happening. Boy, they're really pissed. Well, let's go talk to them. Stick by me. And so we salute Randy Marsh and his unified theory of moderation that has saved us all."

By God, so he is. Black and rich. Time to take this Mr. Jefferson down, just like we did Kobe.  Let's go people! We've got another rich black guy. I want him humiliated and dragged through the dirt, and I want it done by the books! Murphy, you inside? Johnson, what about you? Frakes? All right, when this Jefferson guy shows up, arrest him fast and try not to beat him. There could be neighbors with video cameras.  Why do we do it, Harris? Why is it that us policement around the country have such a passion for framing wealthy African-Americans with crimes they didn't commit? Twenty-five years I've been on the force. I've seen every kind of sick, depraved act known to humanity and still, when I see a black man walk by who has more money than me, I... want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter. But why? Maybe there is no reason. Maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride. Hey Harris Harris Harris! Harris! It's Jefferson! He's back!  All right, people. Let's give Blacky a nice welcome home.  Whoa, wait a minute!  That guy isn't black!  Holy God, his son isn't black either! Oh Jesus!  This is Yeats! Stand down!

If you want to keep reaching out to people, you have to keep up with the times. Remember: big, big, big. Jesus! We're in trouble. The Jimbo and Ned show made up some ridiculous staring frog story and jumped another two points in the ratings! I don't know. We'll have to- continue with the changes we've made and then- go even further. Remember: big, big, big. Ooh, nonono no!  This is the biggest publicity stunt I've ever seen! Damn, those hunters are clever! It's genius, it really is. Hell, I even want to watch then hunt the Mexican staring frog. Unlessü¾ ¼ Unless we can prove to the world that the whole thing is a sham. If we prove that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka is just something- mmade up by Jimbo and Ned, we can have them taken off the air, perhaps even killed! Oh, J. You are so omnipotent, and yet so naive. We launch a full investigation, and in the meantime we can cash in on the videotapes. Good. Okay. Okay, bye! Good news, everybody. This week's ratings are through the roof! We're up to twenty people! No, but I do. We're now the highest rated show on Mountain Cable Access! God bless the Mexican staring frog! We'll start with a two-shot of you and Ned getting your equipment together and- What is it? He is? You getting all this? Get the Flight for Life helicopter! Oh, this is not good. You're corpses out here! We need a lot more action from everybody! Like, go ahead and tell how your nephew Stan takes drugs and worships Satan. You kids, I didn't bring you on this show to be boring. Somebody get pissed off and throw a chair at Ned here. Remember, you all start to fight after the chair is thrown: that is your cue. What is, is- What's happening?! Noooooo! Kid, can I talk to you? Heh, you were really great up there. Too good for a pissant choir in a pissant mountain town. Listen: I'm putting together a rock group. A vocal group called the Ghetto Avenue Boys. I think you would make a perfect member. Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career? Hey, look, if you don't want it, I'll keep looking- I take it that means yes. Call me in the morning. Take 112! Alright, guys, let's take it from the top. Heh? Woh. Uh. R-randy. These are the Avenue Ghetto Street Boys, my... new boy band. Look, kid, you're just getting a little... old to be in a boy band. Get a life, Marsh!  Alright, guys, let's take it from the top. See ya. Damnit, Mitch. How come our movie studio can't come up with any winners? I mean, we're smart, right? We need an idea for a movie that's a home run. A feel-good romp for the whole family.  Hey, what's that over there? Mitch, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? Exactly! Gentlemen, this little boy was kind enough to let us show you his robot. The AWESOM-O 4000.  I've already seen what he can do. It's not? Well, regardless, I believe maybe this automatron can help us come up with new movie ideas. Watch this: AWESOM-O, given the current trends of the movie-going public can you come up with an idea for a movie that will break a hundred million box office? Great, AWESOM-O, great. Uh guys, take a break. I need a minute alone with AWESOM-O.  You are an incredible robot, AWESOM-O. I was just wondering... are you by chance a ...pleasure model? Well, have you been programmed to... satisfy... urges of humans? Let me show you what I mean. Mr. Stallone says he's sorry it couldn't go better for you back there. Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent.  He really likes her voice.  You know, the way she vocalizes the melody,  it brings tears to his eyes. Uh, Mr. Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding. He'll pay her four thousand dollars. Be at this address tomorrow 2 p.m. sharp. And don't be late.

By now you've calmed down the children and kept order by using the 'keep quiet or I'll kill the bunny' technique. Now, it's time to get help. The most important thing to remember is that the children will be safe as long as they stay on the bus. So do not, under any circumstances, let any children off the bus. The best way to achieve this is to tell them something like, 'A big scary monster will eat you if you step off the bus.' That's right. With the children properly subdued, you can leave the bus and go out looking for assistance. And remember your bur driver's code: 'Sit down. And shut up!'"

We just needed to get to the malfunctioning uplink relay. That's right. See, there are dishes in over fifty thousand earthlings' rectums. Your friend's has been malfunctioning. Oh, heavens no! We're a production company. We make intergalactic television programs that the whole universe watches. We at Nerzod Productions started twenty billion years ago with one philosophy: the best universal television isn't scripted, it's real.  We started with great shows like, ""Who Wants To Marry A Gelgamek?"" and ""Antares 6 Millionaire"". And then we had a big hit with ""Get Me Outta Here, I'm a Klingnanian"". But then of course, there's our signature show. The greatest universal reality show of all time. A few billion years ago we realized, ""what if we took species from all different planets in the universe, and put them together, on the same planet?"" Great TV, right? Asians, bears, ducks, Jews, deer and Hispanics, all trying to live side by side on one planet! It's great! Well, you don't think the whole universe works the way Earth does, do you? No! One species, one planet! There's a planet of deer, a planet of Asians, and so on! We put them all together on Earth and the whole universe tunes in to watch the fun! Why? That should get the relay working again. All right, Earthlings, if you'll step over this way we'll erase your memories and get you back to Earth.  Oh, excuse me.  This is Nagix. Uh huh. Oh no. Oh no, really? And it's, it's for sure? All right, I'll break the news to everyone. No, no I, I understand. Thanks.  Well, you kids can go back to Earth if you want, but I'm afraid it won't be there for long. The show's been cancelled."

I'm here at Stark's Pond in South Park, where the crowd of residents and scores of tourists anxiously await the lighting of the largest snake in human history. Now, as most of you will probably remember, snakes are these little round disks that you light, and they spew out a little snake of black ash. Well, the South Park snake is over half a mile in diameter, and twenty stories high. I'm told that this event won't begin until the sun goes down and night is upon us.  Well alrighty then, looks like we're ready. Well, we're coming up on nine hours, and the giant snake of South Park shows no signs of stopping.

Like termites, we will move this film festival from town to town until we have used it up. And then move on, until every quiet mountain town is like Los Angeles. Because we have to live in L.A.

Live, it's the South Park Town Hall Meeting on Public Access. Tonight's topic: Prop. 10. Here in the more arid regions of Africa, the gold-coat lions are in the throes of mating season.  The male lion positions himself behind the female and prepares to insert his lionhood. Notice his large swollen balls.  The female lion relaxes her body and says ""hello"" to Mr. Winky. The male lion is enticed by the female's supple breasts and firm backside.  Quickly and suddenly, the male is finished. Now he wants to be alone, so he kindly asks the female to leave. He promises he'll call her tomorrow. But the female doesn't leave. Nope, she's moving right in. Looks like the male lion... is screwed. Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, it is my pleasure to introduce the reunion tour of Timmehuh! Welcome, everyone, to the 2004 Special Olympics!  We will be holding various throughout the day, and at the end of it all we will have some very special celebrity athletes here to present the trophy for top athlete, along with the cash prize of one thousand dollars. So let's have all our athletes report to their first assigned events and... Let the Games begin! Ladies and Gentlemen, our day of competition has come to an end, and we have an ultimate grand special champion for 2004! Here to present the award are baseball legends Mark McGuire, Jason Giambi, and Barry Bonds. Congratulations, Jimmy. But we all know that the Special Olympics isn't just about winning. And so, we will now give out the Spirit Award, to the handicapped person who came in very last. Eric Cartman!

"DR. DOCTOR","Well, that's the problem. You see, chicken pox is a pretty normal thing for young children. But as you get older it becomes more and more a- ferocious disease. You know, most people don't realize that chicken pox is actually a form of herpes. She'll be fine. We just want to be cautious and monitor her here. Can I talk to you outside? He'll be okay. But it's a good idea for us to monitor him for a while. There there now, it's not your fault. Oh, wow. You did? Wowü¾ ¼ You guys suck. Yes. Stan? Oh, yes. Where is Stan? No, no. He's not missing.

It won't be any easy death, either. The chicken pox will slowly move down his trachea into his lungs. As he chokes for breath the pox will move through his inner ear into his brain, making him think his David Duchovny. Now moving on all fours and wheezing uncontrollably, his cellular structure will regress into a gelatinous mass of- Well, I hope you boys learned your lesson. Going out and playing around with chicken pox almost killed you all! Well just be thankful we got you here in time. Your parents are here to see you, I'll send them in. Boys, I'm afraid your fat little friend has suffered head trauma. Well, apparently, he thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li. What? No, boys! You need to take him home and let him get plenty of sleep. Give the child to me. Uuh. ü¾ ¼ It's a stick. It's over, Mr. Garrison. This is it. We've had enough. Mr. and Ms. McCormick. I'm sorry. We... couldn't save your son. We just didn't get to him in time. There's nothing we could do. Well, we found a... tampon stuck up your child's ass. Apparently, he'd had it up there for several days. It plugged him up until he finally burst from the inside out like a ruptured septic tank. My worry is that he could have been following some kind of crazy new fad. Perhaps the children are all shoving tampons up their ass because they've seen the Backstreet Boys doing it on TV or something. We must get to the bottom of this! ...if you'll pardon the pun. But actually, right now, I've got to carch a plane to Las Vegas to see the Rod Stewart Millennium Show. You're doing fine, Ms. McCormick.  It's alright, Kenny. Come see the miracle of life. I can see its head! Push, now. Push hard!  Oh my God. It's ali- Alright, send him in.  Oh, Stanley. How can I help you? He is really, really sick, Stanley. I was seeing him last week when he first got ill, but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust intuuuh holistic medicine.. Alright, Stanley, I'm going to be very honest with you. Your little friend Kyle needs a kidney transplant. Or it is very possible that... he will die. I know this is a lot to lay on someone your age, but... the rest of the town is so gung-ho in New Age medicine that I have nowhere else to turn. That's very brave, Stan, but I've already checked my records, and you and Kyle aren't a match for kidneys. In fact, there's only one person in South Park with the same blood type as Kyle. Why, hello there, Eric. Oh, I see.  Are you sure that now that it's already out, you don't wanna just let your friend Kyle have it? Well, alright then. We'll get you prepped for surgery.  If you'll just sign this release. Yes, but it was all a trick to get you to come in and sign this release. We believe that you might have a problem. Yes, fat camp. He's dead. The pressure must have killed him. He's very luck you got him here when you did. He was in a very advanced state of vaginitis. It occurs when a person stops eating meat. Those sores on his skin were actually small vaginas. If we hadn't stopped it in time, Stan would have eventually just become one great big giant pussy. We've got an IV of pure beef blood pumping into Stan's veins and the... sores are fading. Five me 50 cc's of ketamine, STAT. And get something for the kid, too. I'm afraid he's... running out of time. It's his time. It's ...running out. He needs to have more time. Well, I suppose we could try a time transplant. I'll have to call in a specialist. Yes, but his time is still getting weaker. It will give out soon unless we do something. Let's not validate his delusions. What?? That's preposterous! What this child needs is a time transplant! I warn you, Ms. Cartman. Your son's time could give out at any minute. He needs to be kept here where his time could be monitored. Your son tried to kill himself in a ritualistic fashion I've never seen before. His chances of surviving are very slim. I'm so sorry. Your son's hand has a hairline fracture and two dislocated fingers. But I'm more concerned about his state of mind. Your son appears to be completely insane. Jesus Christ.  What kind of sick bastard would do this to a dog? Poor little pup. I'm afraid I wouldn't know how. Unfortunately for this little fella, I'm a people doctor. Best we call the animal shelter. He got served. Worst I've ever seen. We just got the X-rays back.  He mostly got served here  and here . But the worst serving was here in the pelvic region. The road to recovery will be a long one. From the test results, it would appear your child was tortured by a bully. He received a massive snuggie, his underwear pulled up so high it nearly killed him. He also received two Indian sunburns on his forearms, a charlie horse on the thigh, and a second-degree titty twister. And from the damage to his head area, it appears he was also given a swirly, a colossal one.  It also appears like he received a noogie, and, a Polish bike ride. We aren't sure. We only know that... there is no cure. Jesus Christ, I've never seen so many Indian sunburns and titty twisters in my life!  Get a cold towel on that pink belly! Over there!  Another wet willie? Give the poor kid some morphine. Boys, you have to let him rest. Some mean kid gave him a Texas Chili Bowl It involves Tabasco sauce, a telephone, and the anus.  I don't know what kind of kid would do this to other people; I only know that I wouldn't ever want to be on that kid's bad side."

Andn since we have been faithful to you, we know that you will send us some good fortune one of these days, even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time. Amen. So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat, lawyer paychecks?"
"MRS. MCCORMICK","That's the whole point, remember?? Their moms want them to catch it while they're young. Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner. Kenny, your little friends are here! Come play with them! I know you're sick! Now get your buns out here! Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner. Let's say grace. Okay, let's dig in. Stuart, don't even get started! That aint why, Stuart!  It's because you are an alcoholic retard and he had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night! What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em! Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother. Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them. You want some more hot water? Naw, we don't go for that hoidy-toidy rich folk stuff. Yehah, well, unfortonately my husband is a washed-up hunk of shit! Oh they wuz best frayends; you couldn't separate 'em. Oh they jus' grew apart, I guess. I think Stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself. Oh, hell no! He's a nugget o' deer turd! Uh-I don't know. How much is all this gonna cost? Wow, what a great country. Everybody's poor, like us. Good job, Kenny. Well, what do you think, Kenny? You'd have to leave your friends and your family behind. Kenny, your dad and I are thinking about having another baby. Wouldn't you like to have another brother or sister? Stop it! Oh, alright. Oh, go ahead. We can make love afterwards. What happened?! Well, Kenny, the doctor confirmed it. I'm pregnant! You're gonna have a little brother or sister. Yup, it's for sure! Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need to start movin' stuff out of your room. Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny. You made my favorite drink for me. But unfortunately, now that I'm pregnant, I can't drink. What's the matter? Kenny?? Don't forget to clean out your room so we can paint it for the baby. Oh, it's all right.  You know, I thnk maybe Kenny's been a little worried about the new baby. We have to show him that he's still our little boy. Come on, Stuart, let's just get you to a bathroom. Oh, hi Kenny. What are ya doin'?  Uh what are you doing, Kenny?  Kenny, what are you going to plunge? Aaaaaaah!  AAAAA! Kenny, GIVE IT UP! Are you alright, Stuart? Our little angel, yes. That's my boy! We didn't, either. Make a sweater? Kenny? Kenny, we're sorry. Where is he? ...and so you see, our son was just playing a joke and the little fat kid put it on the carton. Kenny, don't you think you owe the Thompsons an apology? There there now. Yes, well, aaah-I'll help you find your son. Just stop cryin', Please, for the love of God, stop cryin'! Kenny? Kenny, are you still playin' with that thing?  Kenny, it's been two weeks and you've done nothin' else! Who cares if you almost made it to lever sixty?! You're wastin' your life, Kenny! If you died tomorrow, what would you have to show for it?! You'er gonna end up wishin' you'd done more with your life, just like your dead-beat father! I wasn't talkin' to you, asshole!! I'd like to see you try! It's my house too, you no-good loser! Will he ever recover? He's alive. He-ee smiles when I talk to him. I think... Look, Kenny, your friends are here to visit you again. What? No doctor! You can't!"
"STUART","What? I'm just askin' a question. You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But he got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's Jewish! Hey, is it my fault you don't know how to cook?! You just don't know how to used spices and stuff. Ey! We don't say 'fuck' at the table, you little asshole! I didn't know you like to fish, Gerry. Tackle box? When you're uh-unemployed, weekends are meaningless. Beer? Hu hu hu hu heh yeah. It took us damn near two years to finish it, hu. That's where I live now. Not that easy. You were lucky. You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college. I wanted to be somebody, too! I just wasn't born with a silver enema up my ass! Now don't make me do that again! Uh. Oh! Eeaaaahh! Waww hell, I'm sorry, too. Who the hell could that be? Kenny, wasn't that your fat, racist, foul-mouthed friend, Eric Cartman? Now, remember, if they have left-over turkey, put some in a bag and bring it home, okay? See you in a couple of days, son. Hih yeah, and it's got quite a kick, too. I'm tired of losing this battle! That's right! Maybe we should do what the Confederates would've done and march on to Topeka! Freeze, buddy. These are blanks, but they still hurt like hell! Me, too. Uh, how much do you think a bus ticket back to Colorado is gonna run? What happened? What killed him, doctor? Rod Stewart's gonna be in Vegas? Ah, hello? This is Kenny's dad, back in America. I miss my son very much. I would like to see him returned to me so that the U.S. government will buy me a new car and-  Ow! I mean, bec- because I miss my son very much.  Man. We just might get workin' on it later tonight, huh huh huh. Come on, let's go try to get you pregnant again. Huh? Uh, I'll play catch with your later, son. Aw, alright. Well alright, here comes a pop fly. See if you can catch it!  Good job. Now throw me one.  Ohp! Guhhogh! Aw, he smacked me in the balls! And he fixed my shattered left testicle, too! Well, I can still drink. Ogh, that hits the spot. Makes me forget all about my shattered balls.  What? Wwhat's the matter? Uh, why don't you go make me another one of... of...  Who-o-oa. Oh, God, I'm gonna crap my pants! Oohhh, God!  Oooh, my balls!  Ooh, God Are you sure you should be going on this thing? What did he say?  ...John Denver Experience. Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose! Oh, I'm not gonna make it. I'm gonna be sick!  Oh, my stuhomach!  Oh, my nose!  Augh! Oh my God, it killed Kenny! Kenny, what the hell are you doing?! Kenny?? Kenny?! Kenny, I've had enough of your shenanigans! What the-? No, wait, no, WAH, NO, WAAAAAH! Don't touch me! I've had my nuts broken, body poisoned, have been made love to in the ass by three dozen 40-year-old menü¾³¤¼I just wanna go home and take a, a hot bath! Coo, cootchy-coo, coohoohoohoo, cootchy-coo. Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been hard on both of us losing poor Kenny. But this new baby kind of reminds me of him. Well, now, that's part of the fun! You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge. Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader! He's really, really gay. I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys?? Uh, Kenny, it's nine o'clock. Uh huh! Your wife, huh? Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then. Yeah. Now they're acting like men. I heard that. Kenny? Yeah. Why, just this afternoon our son was caught beatin' off our dog. What the hell was that? Yep, me too. How is it? Now, come on, everybody, just because a few priests in the country have been corrupted doesn't mean that all priests are child molesters. Yes? Uh... boys... Kenny died ...last December. Don't you remember? We haven't seen you boys for so long, we thought you'd forgotten all about him. No. That's an urn, boys. Kenny's inside it. Thang-thanks for coming by, boys. Ih-ih, it means a lot to us.  Aw now, honey. Kenny, do you by any chance know what happened to my Playboys?  Kenny?! Answer me!! You WHAT?? If the Founding Fathers saw you burning your flag an' callin' the President a Nazi, they'd roll over in their grave! Well your side has the grocery store. Well nobody wants to hear a bunch o' rock protest songs! Kenny. What are you doing over here with all these unAmerican traitors?! Look! My son is a patriot and LOVES his country!  Come on, Kenny! NOW! Eh-ah, I guess we owe you one. We can be a nation that believe in war, Sit down, Jer-Jer! Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is on. Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight, but you appreciate the gay culture. We can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers! Hey Jefey. You want some cerveiza? Hey, I heard that, bitch! How about I come in there and kick your teeth in! Goddamnit, do you have to smart off at me in my own house?! It's a miracle... Kenny, you're alive. He can't more on hiw own-ah how will he eat? I I don't know if it's right to keep Kenny alive on that machine. I I just... I don't know what he would want. Wha, what's the matter, doctor?"

Perhaps someday I can get a bone-marrow transplant.  Yes, little boy? Well I don't know. But anyway, boys and girls, soon you'll be witnessing the wonders of the universe. But first, I wanna show you how the plane'arium works. Ughuh, little Missy here runs the big projector for us. Come on. Let's get into the plane'arium, shall we? Good morning, children, and welcome to the plane'arium. We're going on a fascinating ride through the universe, so I want you to lean back in your chairs and get comfortable. And now I'm going to dim the lights and let the starsü¾ ¼ ehcome out. Here we see the constellatiion called, ""The Big Dipper"" If I project a drawing of a big dipper on top of it,  a-hah , we see where this constellation gets its name. These stars over here form the constellation of Taurus, the Bull , while these stars form the constellation, ""Roger Ebert"" . And these two little stars over here form the constellation The Crusades .

To remember it will cause incredible pain.  Incredible pain!  Incredible icky paaiin! Well, children, I'm so glad you came back to learn more. Well, I'm sure we're going to have a marvelous time. Won't we, children? Billions of stars and billions of galaxies make up our universe. Here you see Polaris, the dog star. Certainly, Mr. Garrison.  You love the planetarium! To be without the planetarium causes you horrible pain! All you want to do is help the planetarium thrive! To not do so makes your stomach ache with needlelike stab-  and right over here we see the constellation Orion. Orion's belt is made up of three stars, one of which is actually a pulsarü¾ ¼ Goodbye, children. Thanks for coming. Well, Clyde, if you like the plane'arium so much, perhaps you'd like to do some volumteer work here. Mr. Garrison? Excellent! Why don't we step over here and I'll show all you children how to volunteer. Thank you. I'd like to open an invitation to all South Park residents to come see a special free show this evening. I guarantee, it will change the way you think about the plane'ah-arium Oh. Hello, officer of the law. What brings you out here? Oh, really? Actually, this is a pretty inopportune time. Of coure, officer. Come on in. Would you like to see the stars, officer? And this is the constellation called Cassiopeia And now, officer, from this moment on, you will think that you are Elvis Presley. To not be Elvis will cause you great pain. You see, children? There's no stopping me. Even your highly intelligent policemen are no match for me. Why? Because nowadays kids have computers, surround-sound television. They've forgotten all about plane'ariums. But I'll make them remember, starting with the two of you! No, you idiot! He thinks he's Elvis. Elvis, escort our guests to the plane'arium. Aaah. Aaah. Aaah."

I'm a lawyer defending a major record company, and I'm talkin' about Chewbacca! Does that make sense? Ladies and gentlemen, I am not making any sense! None of this makes sense! And so you have to remember, when you're in that jury room deliberatin' and conjugatin' the Emancipation Proclamation,  does it make sense? No! Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, it does NOT MAKE SENSE! If Chewbacca lives on Endor, you must acquit! The defense rests. Wait!  Mr. Chef, this music has really touched me. I'd like to take up your case, free of charge! I will. We'll see you in court, Mr. Record Producer. Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, you must now decide whether or not to reverse the decision for my client, Chef.  I know he seeems guilty, but ladies and gentlemen, thisü¾ ¼ is Chewbacca. Now think about that for one minute: that does NOT MAKE SENSE! Why am I talkin' about Chewbacca when a man's life is on the line?  Why? I tell you why. I don't know. It doesn't make sense. If Chewbacca does not make sense, you must acquit!  Here, look at the monkey. Look at the silly monkey."
"JURY FOREMAN","We find the defendant, Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy, guilty as charged."
"BAILIFF","Uh, sir, it's for four years. All rise."
"BUTLER","Can I help you? No, I'm one of his butlers. He doesn't do private readings. Alright, come on in. Just wait here. I'll go fetch him. Here he is. Hey, Joseph! I told my wife that you spoke with God and Jesus, and she didn't believe it. You see? You believe it now? Found what?"
"ELTON","Sir Elton John. I was knighted, you know. I'm sorry. Bu' I'm not a big candy bar fan. Chef! You mean, 'Chef' Chef? Of course! I haven't seen him in so long. I remember when I first met him. It was about 25 years ago. I was just a struggling musician , and couldn't get a break.  ELTON Thanks, Chef. I just don't understand what my music is missing. I really thought I had it this time with ""Cheddar Cheese Girl."" That's a great idea! And so I got Bernie to write my lyrics. And if it wasn't for Chef, I would never've had a career in music. Yes, of course. I'll buy three Crispy Yum-Yums. Sure, kid. But I would retain exclusive worldwide rights,  including but not limited to Asian territories, with a 20% commission from all domestic sales, and sole ownership of any and all publishing. Tell Chef I said 'hi.' Howdy ho, boys! It occured to me that you might need some more help raising money for Chef. So I called a few friends, and we all decided to come over. I see you've got a stage all set up for us. Then, let's rock and roll! Or something simlar. Thank you all for coming to help Chef. This is a song written by a veerry special little boy  I have no idea what his name is. Agh, who the hell cares? Anyway, he wrote it for his girlfriend. You know I do want you"
"MEATLOAF","Yeah. What the hell do you want? What's this for? Chef's in trouble? Do I? I owe eveything to Chef. You bet. Give me a box of Nilla Yum-Yum's and a couple of Berry Bars."
"RICK","Sure. I'll do anything for Chef. Give me a box of those Choco-Numbers. Mmmmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mmmm. God bless you, Chef! Alan, I'm standing at ground zero. Here, the damage is greater than anywhere. Like the rest of the world, everyone here has crapped their pants. Some crapped themselves to death. And still others ...ruined perfectly good pairs of pants. A nation mourns and tries to rebuild, but the big question that remains is, ""How did this happen?"" Hi, Satan. I'm doing great! Why don't you come on out and we'll get yo oriented.  I'll take care of him from here, ma'am. Eric, this is the beginning of a whole new life for you! Alright! Everybody's here and that means we can get down to business! Over the next few weeks we're gonna learn that losing weight is  fun, right gang? Wait a second.  Do you kids hear something? I could've swore that- Oh no, kids! It's glutinous fat! Oh! What are we going to do? Wait! I know! I could knock it out! With... Exercise! And... Proper Diet. I guess we took care of that bad old fat, didn't we kids? Well, hold on a second. Because that glutinous fat was really our good friend, Susan,  who's another weight counselor! Doing great kids! Come on! Well, I sure enjoyed my carrots and protein bar! How about you, gang? Hey kids! Escape-aroo! Now campers, I know that camp is tough, but you have to believe that you can do it. And you have to know that until you drop the weight, you can't leave. So let's just all put on our try-hard helmets, and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE THE WEIGHT Alright campers, good work today. Lights out, and we'll see you tomorrow for more exercise and proper diet. I don't know what we're doing wrong, Susan. These kids aren't losing the weight. They'll do it. And we're gonna reach fo the sky... And up to the sky... What's happening? Oh! But he's not ready yet. They can lose the weight if they try. Good-bye, Chad. Naturally. Oh, don't thnak us. We failed you. Well, it's alright with me. Parents? Bubbye. Yes. Yes, we are. But our funding has been cut and now we're forced to ride... You're going to see the new Prime Minister. Oh, I would so like to meet him myself. It's his strange new laws that took our horses away. Perhaps I will go with you. Follow me this way! We're going to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada! All right boys, prepare yourselves. We're about to enter... French Canada. Just stay calm, boys. French Canadians are a little... odd. Oh my! This certainly is a desolate place! We must be very close now. Waaaah! What are you two doing helping these Americans?! Don't you know America thinks it owns Canada along with the rest of the world?! Woo, that was a close call. Thank you, kind Newfie! Ohh, that's right. Ottawa is that way. It's okay, boys. The power is inside us to get to Ottawa! We can wish ourselves there! Is it working? Oh yes! On the river we could travel to Ottawa in no time! Then, I suppose us mounties will never get our horses. Hey, that looks like Saddam Hussein! Wait a minute. This means all the Prime Minister's new laws are null and void. We can have our horses back! Ey, come on, boys! You can spend Christmas with us, Canada style!"
"OFFICER","All right, you. It's time to go! Let's go. I don't tell you how to do your job, don't tell me how to do mine! Hey, there he is! That's Charlie Manson! Come back here, God damnit!  He's getting away! Fudgecicle! Tell him we won't shoot him, Boss. 1-Marshmallow, 2-Marshmallow,ü¾ ¼ 90-Marshmallow, 91-Marshmallow  This is making me hungry for marshmallows 92-Marshmallow Ow! Hey you kids. What the hell do you think you're doin'? You sure you don't want to press charges? Hey Sergeant, take a look at this. Looks like a new family has just moved into South Park. One Mr. Jefferson, age 50, bought a house there and paid cash. He seems to have a lot of money. Take a look. Says here...  He's black. You boys! Trent is trying to tell us the fire was YOUR idea. I thought so. All right, that's it, Trent. You're going to Juvenile Hall for a long time! So let me get this straight. That woman over there was trying to get to her balls which were in the knees of a black child whose father is a dolphin. Sounds like an open and shut case. All right, let's head 'em out! Stay back, people!"
"TEEN MC","Okay. Thanks for coming to Chef Aid, everybody! Are you ready to rock and roll?!  Woo!  All right, let's get things going withü¾ ¼ Rancid!!  Ran-cid! Rick James, ladies and gentlemen!

"RANCID","California sun has sunk"
"LES CLAYPOOL","We're damned proud to be here to support our good buddy, Chef. It was Chef who told us in the early days, to keep trying and to keep pursuing our dreams, no matter how much we sucked. I love that man."
"JOE","You know, in the Classroom Tour, we lost a beat. Chef would be like it was so offstage going, ""Don't forget. Pump your loins, children.""  You know, it was like his mo'o, or something. Well it's a rockin' world, make no mistake about it I don't know about that. I just thought I'd keep to me blacksmithing.  Ey, look! I've made me a metal fire poker. Alright. Look 'ere, I made me a metal orange. Oh, lookie heeah!  I've gone and made a metal newspaper! Well, for starters we can look in the want ads and see if we can find Pip a job. Ohhh, lookie here! Young man wanted for paid position! You can keep a little girl company for 20 quid a day, Pip. And Old Mrs. Havesham is the wealthiest woman in the town. And so you bang on this side, and bang on that side, and there you have it. Your very own metal fuzzy dice. Eeyyyy, what's all this, Pip? Sure! They're those things with vaginas in them. Oh, I don't know about that. I just like to keep to me blacksmithin'. Oh. D'ooooh. No, I don't think so, Pip. Who could that be? The same. Oh, well, uh Pip's not for sale, sir. Heaven forbid I should stand in the way of Pip's future, but- That's great news! I am, sir. Pip!  A young gentleman! Of great expectations! Pip? Pip, old chap? That's right. You're safe and warm now. Well, about that, Pip: There's another person who wants to see you. 'E's the one that sent you to London, Pip! 'E's the one who sent you off to be a gentleman! What's that, Pip. Yeah! Your manhating days are over, Ms. Havesham! Pip, she started the device! Oy can't figh' 'em off no moh! ...There's too many of them! You did it, Pip! Well, I guess Old Ms. Havesham won't be takin' any revenge on any more blokes, ey? This is a wake up call to America. We cannot turn our backs on gays anymore!"
"OZZY","We're all here to help our good friend, Chef, who has touched our lives in the past.  I remember when I was just starting out. Chef suggested I buy a pompadour hat. I thought he said, ""bite the head off a bat,"" so I did. And the rest, oh, it's just history. Now, let's go freakeeee! You kids  don't  around with your  mom!"
"DEAN","We're proud to be a part of Chef Aid. Whoa, dude, that was Steve's idea. I don't know, dude. I though you knew him."

"AUNT FLO","Hello, Stanley. Remember me? Hey, Stanley. I brought you and Shelley presents. Okay, Shelley. This one's for you. It's a televisionCD playersurround sound home theater. Your very own fish. I think he likes you.  Come on Shelley. Let's hook up your home theater. Is there a problem? Do you not like your goldfish? I'm sorry. I'm a bad aunt. Sharon! Look at you, with your little shovel. Just like when you were twelve. Ooh, hello, boys. I'm Stan's Aunt Flo. Nn-oh.  I got it from the pet store, Stanley. Let's see. I believe it was called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store,"" just outside of town. I know I have the address written down somewhere.  Let me look."
"STANLEY","Hi, Aunt Flo."
"EVIL CARTMAN","Wow, you don't see this every day. It's like I'm looking in a mirror. I'm sorry I caused so much trouble. This is all very strange to me, too. Well, I was just standing around, and Stan and Kyle were being really mean, as usual, and Kenny had just bought a new car. This is amazing! I can't believe how nice you are, Chef. In my world, you're a skinny, white insurance salesman. I'll help you, Stan. Can do! I don't see any pet stores called ""Indian Burial Ground."" What's so funny about that? Who's my kitty? Who's my little kitty? My fluffy little cat. Yeah, that's good, yeah, that's my nice little kitty, yeah. You guys, I found the pet store! Listen, friend. You can't sell people pets like this. You have to have a sign that says, ""Warning: these fish are from an evil, parallel universe."" Now, it's not our fault you disrespected the bodies of this land's native people, but by golly , you're gonna take this fish back. And sir, can I make a suggestion? Move your store, and let these great people of the Wampanoag rest in peace. No, Kyle. Murder is never an answer. Hey, you guys. We still have time to enter the pumpkin-carving contest. Come on! I bet that together we can make the best pumpkin ever! Yuh, thanks, you guys. I certainly like you a lot more than in my evil, parallel universe. Let's use Kenny's squash. Hooray! Oh, no!  Stan and Kyle have come to take my back to my world, and I don't wanna go back! Please! Well, good-bye, you guys. It's been fun."
"OFFICER BABRADY","Well, there's been a report of a few missing people. Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them. No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though? Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I?  Well, this all looks in-  oh? Tennis anyone?"
"EVIL KYLE","We're looking for Cartman. The trail ended here. Where is he? Maybe this will jog your memory! We're here to take you back, Goody Two-Shoes! Come on, Mr. Wholesome! We're taking you back to our universe! Hall right! Just stand there, Cartman! This gingerification gun will send you back to our universe! Shut your trap, kid! Noooooo!"
"BOTH CARTMANS","I am! He is!"
"CARTMAN ON LEFT","Time is running out. You'll have to destroy us both. It's the only way you can be sure. We have to both go, for the good of the world. How did you guys know?"
"CARTMAN ON RIGHT","What?! Noooo! Screw you guys!"
"UNCLE STINKY","Nice to have you heuh. That can't be!"
"FLORENCE","Come here, Eric. Give you great-grandma some huggies. Oh, which one is he, then? God-damn it, why the hell do I always have to say Grace? If one more person asks me to say Grace, I'll be like, ""Eh! I'm not saying Grace! And if you ask me again, I'll kick you square , in the nuts!"" Sshhhh! We're watching television."
"ELVIN","Sweet. Sweet! Kick ass! You guys, seriously! Mr. Hankey kicks ass! Kickass!"
"HOWARD","No I don't. Come on, let's eat already! They gave me extra bread and water! Yeah, well I'b I busted out. Sshhhh! You can't let the rest of the family know I'm here. If it's okay, we're just gonna hang out here for a couple of days with you kids. Come on up, it's okay.  Another inmate busted out with me. Don't worry, he's a good guy. All right, Chuck, but we gotta lay low for a while. All right, Chuck. Let's watch some TV or something. Hey, bring us down some food, all right? Chuck, can you turn that thing down? Okay, Chuck! Thank you very much! Wow, sweet! What's the matter? Oh, bummer. Uh, that's okay, Chuck. You just keep watching Christmas specials. The cops are here! Get down, Ma! What the hell is wrong with you, Manson? You're acting all funny! Everybody just sit down and shut up! We're not going back to the big house! Wow, she's really pissed. Damn it! What are we gonna do? Damnit, Dad, why didn't you put a back door on this house?! That's it! We're going out the bathroom window! Come on, Manson! Come on, damn it!  Well, it's good seeing you all. Don't move until we're gone or I'll shoot you dead. Happy holidays. All right, it's open! Let's go! All right, kid, you can come. Now, let's go. What?! Now can we go?? Oh, weak! Well, I guess I'll be going, Mom and Dad. I hope you can forgive me. I always do. See ya, Eric. Thanks for all your help."
"UNCLE HOWARD","Oh. Hey, Eric. I didn't think anybody'd be down here."
"INMATE","Oh, hi boys. I'm Charlie. Charlie Manson. It sucks, just like all your other books. Shut up!"
"MANSON","I can't wait to get out among the pigs and raise some hell. When I stand up on the mountain and say, ""Do it!"", it gets done! And it it don't get done, then I'll move on it! And that's the last thing in the world you wamt me to do. You know what the spirit of Christmas is? It's another lie, from the lyin' pigs that consider me the witness-! Heyyy! I'll take you! Hey, I didn't bust out of prison to be locked up in somebody's basement! I want some action! Come on! I'll hot-wire your Grandpa's car! All right, boys, keep your heads down! We're goin' to the mall! How would you like to come with me to a more secluded part of the mall? Folks need to understand that I am terror! I am fear! I am-! Oh, hey look, another holiday special. Wow, man. That's beautiful. He was evil, but now he's good. Well, how was it? Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, I went to a beauty parlor and had my tatto redone.  Look! Oh. He'sü¾ ¼ around. Come on, I'll buy you kids an orange Smoothie. Run for your lives, boys! Keep your heads down, kids! They're gaining on us! Get in the house! Hey, man, don't point a gun at your own mother! I'm glad I'm not you right now, kid. But I gotta see what happens. Huh?! But Stan, your mother and father are out there! Stan, I wanna talk to you about family. You see, I had a family once. At least, I called them my family. Really, they were nothin' but a gang of people I thought were my friends. Ah after we killed a bunch of people together, I realized that my real family was who took care of me, and who took the time to care about what I did. If they don't care about you, would they have driven nine hours to Nebraska? No, Howard. You go ahead. I've got something to say. Folks, I apologize for this whole mess. I'm going to surrender. Somebody show the police a white flag. Oh my God, they killed the little orange-coat kid! Good! I deserve to! I can never make it up to the families that I destroyed, but at least I'll make an example for anyone else thinking that crime  is an answer. You see, I get it now! I finally understand what the holidays are all about. Boys, don't you see? You can't let things get you down during the holidays, because being happy is what the holidays are all about! I've been such a bastard all these years, and I finally understand. And it it it feals great! I'f I feel like, I feel like I'm in my own Christmas special. You see, Happy Kwanzaa, too. You're darn right I do. And I guess that's what I've learned. I'm sorry for what I did, but that doesn't make up for it. I deserve to be in jail. All I hope is that I don't make mankind lose faith in itself. Yes, there's murderers in the world. There's rapists and thieves. But those are the vast minority. The majority of mankind is made up of caring people, who try every day to do what they think is right. And that's the spirit of the season. What do you think, guys? Well, Guh Good night, you guys. Happy Holidays. What was that  What the?!"
"GEORGE BAILEY","You-oo you just can't buy people, Mr. Potter, wuh. Why, you know what you are? You're a little bitch.  That's right, you're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you? Oh, Mary. Mary, you're real! Hello, movie house!  Hello, burger parlor!"
"STINKY","Come on, Team! Not now, Eric.  Hold him! He has him! Where's the flag?! I said ""no,"" and I mean ""no!"" Respect my authorituh! What?! Quiet down, we're watching television."

"FIELD REPORTER","This is Robert Pooner reporting live from Nebraska, where escaped convict Charlie Manson has walled himself up in a house.  We understand that there are hostages, and that the situation is critical, , so we would like to remind you all that this live hostage crisis is being brought to you by Palmoral Sun Block . Remember, if it isn't Palmoral, you're gonna get cancer. Tom, I'm standing about two miles outside of Denver where the darling handicapped boy fights for his life on a wheelchair of death.  Guys, can you tell us what kind of explosive we're actually dealing with here. Tom, I understand that now, the rescuers are gonna try and send in one of the handicapped boy's little friends, in an attempt to keep him calm and hopefully, disarm the device. Tom, I'm standing in front of the house where three insane boy terrorists have barricaded themselves inside a room with twenty-three live infant cattle. Several attempts to break into the room have proven unsuccessful, Tom, and the crisis is intensifying. Here's what some people have to say. The police chief of South Park says that there will be no negotiations with terrorists. Tom, it looks like I have an update: Yes, it looks like the boy terrorist story is not interesting news to anyone. Uh, nothing else was going on, Tom, so this was the only story we had to make seem important, but people are just simply tuning out. So, HBC will now be switching programming once again to ""Puppoies from Around the World."" Tom, the calf terrorist standoff continues as now members of the FBI arrive to put an end to the conflict. Tom, it looks as though the terrorists are now loading the baby cows into the back of a semi. This is still very uninteresting news, Tom. Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where last December, eight-year-old Kenny McCormick died of a terminal illness. But now, that little boy's three closest friends miss their friend so much that they are building a ladder to heaven, in order to-  a ladder to heaven in order to try to see him again.  It's so sad and yet so beautiful, Tom. Here's what some people had to say. Tom, people from all over the-  Sorry. People from all over the country are coming to see the ladder, feeling a connection to its symbolism, and beauty. Even country singer Alan Jackson has shown up with a song he has written about the ladder.  Alan Jackson is, of course, the man who wrote the song, ""Where Were You When the World Stopped Turning,"" about the tragedies on September 11. And now he's here once again to capitalize on people's emotions. Let's listen in. Tom, it's been five days since three sweet boys set out to build a ladder to heaven and caption the nation's hearts. They've made a nation believe heaven might be up there. And it could prove to be a threat to our country. President Bush will seek UN approval for military action. But... what about yoru lost friend? What about your fragile innocence and believing we could all get to heaven? Tom, I'm standing in chilly South Park, Colorado, where the residents are entering the third day of their sit-in to try and stop Native Americans from building a superhighway through their town. The temperature is low, but spirits are pretty low, too. Tom, it now looks as if the Native Americans are handing out blankets as a sign of goodwill towards the South Park people. What an incredible display of compassion. I certainly hope there's nothing sinister behind it. Tom, it's Tuesday morning now, and the outbreak of SARS in South Park has reached epic proportions.  The entire town has been quarantined by the federal government, nobody allowed in our out, which means, nobody can come to our aid.  It appears this town, and this reporter, are done for. Coming up next, choosing the right hair conditioner. What you don't know about hair care products could be costing you a bundle. Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the rock band, MOOP, has refused to play. The strike started yesterday and could go well into next week. Tom, we're now entering the second day of the rock band MOOP's refusal to play, and the second day of absolutely no other news to report on. In a recent poll we asked people if MOOP's refusal to play would stop them from downloading music off the Internet. One percent said yes. Two percent said no. And ninety-seven percent said, ""Who the hell is MOOP?!"" Back to you, Tom. Tom, it appears now the musicians' strike is growing! As I'm speaking, more musicians are arriving! It looks like Alanis Morissette, Blink 182, Britney Spears, and dozens of others are going to join MOOP in not playing music. This is a veritable Strikapalooza! Tom, I'm standing outside of the Department of Motor Vehicles, where senior citizens have until three p.m. to hand over their driver's licenses. The new law was passed just three days after the Night of Horror, in which all seniors were out driving at the same time, causing fourteen deaths and three million dollars in damage. Tom, it has now been three days since the Stotch child has gone missing. Townspeople continue to search, but hope... is dwindling."
"CHIEF STEVENS","We've got a critical situation, ma'am. Charlie Manson is holding everybody inside hostage. Yes, ma'am. Come out with your hands up! Look out, he's got a white flag! They're surrendering! You're going back to prison to rot, Manson! What?? Stop that. Happy Holidays, Bob. Come on, Manson. You belong in jail"
"ROBERT POONER","Still more developments in the Manson hostage crisis. Uh, it appears now that eight-year-old Stan Marsh  is in BIG, big trouble. He apparently disobeyed his parents, left home without telling them, and uh, Tom, his- his mother is very disappointed with him. And so, Manson is hauled off to jail to rot in his cell. Everything is back to normal, and I guess the only thing left to say is, God bless us, every one."
"COPS","Okay, grab a hold of him. You're under arrest, buddy. Waaah!"

They're goin' to premiere their new Raiders of the Lost Ark, and we have to rescue them! Do you understand?! No! Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God! Hello! I'm gonna blow up the print, Spielberg! That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends. Except for Cartman - you can keep him. Then your premiere has no movie! Ah, what?! Oh my God! But what about the original prints of Raiders of the Lost Ark? What if somebody Cartman likes to play with dolls? You... guys wanted me to meet you here? Oh God. Oh God!

I'm not supposed to talk to you! But it could be a trick!  Ugh. That's a pretty good trick. AaaaAAAHH! The Ghost of Human Kindness? What do you want? Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems that everywhere I turn, someone is out to get me. It isn't? I think so. You mean that, even though all the news is about murderers and abductors, those kind of people... only make up a very small part of the world. I'll... try. Your van? What the hell is going on?? No I didn't mean to. Triben fak burushban. Conifer?? Walking there would take hours! Me too."
"MR. TWEEK","Hello there, customer. Great. What can I get for you? Large coffee, small coffee? Oh, you're that corporate guy who's been calling. Oh, forget it, my my store is not for sale. Uh, I don't think so. My coffee shop is worth a lot to me. The answer is still no, Mr. Postem. You see, when my father opened this store 30 yars ago, he cared about only one thing: making a great cup of coffee. Sure, we may take a little longer to brew a cup, and we may not call it fancy names, but I guess we just care a little more.  And that's why Tweek Coffee is still home-brewed from the finest beans we can muster. Yes, Tweek Coffee is a simpler cup, for a simpler America. But that could put me out of business. Hi, Officer Barbrady. Oh, just some dong. What can I get for you. Bye-bye. They want me to sell the store, and it's so much money. I know, but if they open a Harbucks right next door, we might go out of business. They really have my balls in a vice grip. Country fresh, like the morning after a rainstorm. Oh. I've got one for you. How about doing a report on how large corporations take over little family-owned businesses. No, I'm- serious, hon. These boys should learn how the corporate machine is ruining America. You see, I own a coffee shop and now a great, big, multi-million dollar company is going to move in and try to take all my business, which means I may have to shut down and sell my son Tweek into slavery. Yes, slavery. They really have my balls in a salad shooter. Wuh-okay, but corporate takeovers is a much more fertile subject. Actually, honey, I think those little tykes are just what we need. I've got an idea. How's the report going, boys? Oh, do you need some more coffee? Well. Boys, ub. I don't mean to pry, but, if you want it, I wrote your report for you. Yes, it's all about corporate takeovers. Of course, you don't have to use it... All right.  And it can be our little secret about who wrote it, right? Now, when you give the report,  just make sure that you read this part first, okay? My pleasure. G'night, boys. Yes, it is.  They really have my balls in a juice maker.  Oh, hello, son, uh. How did your report go? Really?? Well, son, you might have just saved the family business.What do you have to say about that? I know how you boys feel.  Sometimes a hot cup of French Roast Amaretto is just what a man needs to get him through the day. That smooth aroma and mild taste is what make Tweek coffee... uh very special. Special, like an Arizona sunrise or a juniper wet with dew. A light rain in the middle of a dusty afternoon or a hug from your dear old aunt- . What? Oh, sorry. Here you go. Oh, hello committee members. What a surprise. Yes. How did you hear? Oh, you'll do fine, son. Wow, it it's great! What do you think, hon?  Hon? What's the matter? What do you mean? But, kids are great to get people on our side. Honey, all's fair in love and war. And coffee. Hon? Hu- hon? Uh, Mr. Postem, I'm afraid you've got a lot to learn about making coffee. Uh I'm sorry to inform you that this town is having a vote tomorrow, and if the law passes, you're gonna be thrown out of town. At five o'clock, the best coffee wins. Either your coffee, or a fresh, warm cup of... Tweek's coffee.  Like an old sweater that keeps getting warmer with age, you can count on Tweek's coffee to start your day. Hey. Hey, that is good. It's subtle and mild. Mild, like that first splash of sun on an April morning. This coffee is coffee the way it should be. It isn't soon enough."
"CUSTOMER","Hello. How are you today? I'm actually interested in something else. I'm John Postem from the Harbucks Coffee Corporationü¾ ¼ You know, he claims he spoke with God and Jesus."
"POSTEM","That's right. How come yuu don't call me back? All we wanna do is buy out your coffee shop here. My company's prepared to make you a veerry generous offer.  This is a Cramsonite briefcase. All leather, it has four compartments and a keyless lock. Interested? Well all right.  How about $500,000? Well, that's too bad. We're just gonna have to open our Harbucks right next door to you. Hey, this is a capitalist country, pal! Get used to it! Good! Good! Now, make sure that sign is really bright and flashy now. Excuse me?! Hey, I'm not fat or smelly! Postem! My argument is simple. This country's founded on free enterprise. Harbucks is an organization that-. An organization that prides itself on great coffee! We simply want tuh- Oh, to hell with you! What?! Damn, these people aren't buying any coffee! I'll have to try and appeal to the younger crowd! Hey, kids. I'm Camel Joe and I love a fresh cup of coffee. It's yum diddly-icious. And it makes you feel super!  I have a surprise for you: the new kiddicino from Harbucks. More sugar and all the other goodies kids like with all the caffeine of a normal double latte. Why don't you go back to the hole you crawled out from, lady?! Oh, and you don't? Your coffee tastes like three-day-old moldy diarrhea! What?! William, it looks like Harbucks will never make it in this town.  All right, boys, that's it. Pack it up, we're movin' out of town. I know, but these folks obviously don't want us here. Oh, quit being so melodramatic, Sanchez. Jesus Christ. It's a French roast. Hehey, no hard feelings, Tweek. You know, we still need someone to run this Harbucks coffeehouse. I'm sure it will make a lo-o-ot of money."
"MRS. TWEEK","Some things are more important than money.  The people of South Park count on you to give them that first cup of coffee every day. Oh, hello, son. How was your day? That's good. Who are your little friends? Well, have some coffee boys. I'll brew up another pot for later. Hoh, you'll like this coffee. It's fresh Richard! Now, Tweek, how many times do we have to tell you? Your underpants are missing because you lose them, not because of underpants gnomes. Honestly, Richard. I don't see why you have to preach to some eight-year olds. My goodness. That's going to be a huge coffee house, honey. Liike, how do you mean? Uhoh that. He has ADD, Attention Deficit Disorder. That's why he's so jittery all the time. I have a big problem with this! We are just using those boys for our benefit. They have no idea what they're saying. You don't just throw a child in a political commercial to sell your beliefs. I won't be a part of this anymore. These boys are absolutely right. We've been using these poor kids to pull at your heartstrings for our cause, and it's wrong. We're as low and despicable as Rob Reiner. You keep protesting and complaining, but did any of you ever even bother to taste Harbucks coffee? Harbucks coffee got to where it is by being the best. Don't you think you should at least try it? Oh my, he looks terrible. Uh. I'm just going to go upstairs and see if Tweek is still in his bed. It's okay. I can do it. That I don't abduct him? How do I know that you haven't done it already?? That's not what the new study says! I hope something happens soon to put an end to this whole fad. What the hell did that show do to them?"
"LADY MEMBER","Great job! Boys, you have really opened our eyes. We didn't even know this was happening. Well, Mr. Garrison, it looks like we were wrong about you. You really are teaching these kids something. Aw, I am really moved. I say we follow these boys's cause. Let's join them in the fight against corporate takeovers! Lead the way, boys! Mr. Tweek, we've only just heard. So, this is the corporate bulldozer trying to push you off the map. Don't worry, Mr. Tweek. This committee is not going to let you be run out of business by these bastards! Do you hear that? You're not gonna get away with this, you whore!"" ...And we would have never even known that this was happening if not for these boys' excellent report. That's right. Yes! Mayor, these boys want that Harbuck's coffee shut down right now! But they're ruining our city! What do you say, boys? We're gonna pass a law! Well, what do you think? Yes it is. We'll put it on the air immediately. Toto, ladies and gentlemen! All right. And now, before we all vote yes on Prop. 10, here to remind us why are the lovable, innocent children. That's not what you said last time!"

"THE OTHER MEMBERS","Hooray!"
"MEDIATOR","Should Harbucks be allowed to open a store in South Park? That's tonight's topic. On my left, five innocent, starry-eyed boys from Middle America.  On my right, a big, fat, smelly corporate guy from New York. All right, Mr. Douchebag- Oh. Pardon me, Mr. Assfaced. Anyway, let's hear your side of the argument. Okay, Uckyoufay. Now for the other side of the argument we turn to our young, handsome lads.  Boys, your thoughts. Come on, boys, don't be shy. What's your principal argument? Great argument! You win, boys!"
"AUDIENCE","Boo! Boo! Hhssssssss! Yeah! Yeah! Woo! Booooo!! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Awww! Awgh! Hooray! Four, three, two, one! OOOOHHHHHH! Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Aww Hooray!

"BLONDE PROTESTER","It's people like you who are ruining Main Street, U.S.A.!!"
"GNOME","Is that all you've got, pussy?! You're a pussy, pussy! Stealing underpants biiig business. Sure, that's what gnomes do. O-kay. Follow me. Not much longer now. No, pussy, I'm taking you to my village. Follow me. This is where all our work is done. Collecting underpants is just phase 1. Phase 1: collect underpants. Hey, what's phase 2? Yeah yeah yeah, but. What about phase 2? You bet we do! Holy shit! We've killed your friend. Well, we can explain that to you easily. You know. Red Sleiogh 2, come in. You're coming up on the source of the signal. You're right on top of him!"

"CENTER GNOME","Jesus Christ, look out!"
"SUPPORTER","Underpants gnomes? What?"
"AUSSIE","I've got to be careful. So, what I'm gonna do is sneak up on it and jam my thumb in its butthole. If I get bit out here, I'm 200 kilometers from the nearest hospital: I'd better be real careful jamming my thumb in its butthole.  Oh, boy, it's pissed off now. I'm gonna jam my thumb it its butthole now! This should really piss it off! Oh, yeah, that piossed it off, all right!  I've gotta be careful! Well! That was quite an angry croc! But I managed to escape with only a few bruises and a shattered left testicle. Next week we'll look for more of these beautiful creatures, so we can learn more about them by pissing them off immensely. Thanks for watching. This grizzly bear has the strength of over ten Morgan Freemans. I'm really pissing him off right now. Sure I can! I can hunt down anything! Wait a second.  I think he came through here recently. Calm down, calm down. Wait! Look! No! It's a Rocky Mountain rattle snake. This is the most poisonous snake in this entire region.  Now, what I'm gonna do, is carefully sneak up on him, and jam my thumb up his butthole. Crikey! Oh, this snake is really pissed!! I'm gonna jam my thumb in his butthole now! Awww, yeah, that pissed it off all right! The trail ends here. No worries. Come back here, you! Oh, he's a wily one! Notice the dilated pupils of this prehistoric man. A sure sign the prey is frightened. As well as he should be, as I will now jam my thumb up his butthole. Now I've got you pinned. I win! Now for the coup de gras. I'll justü¾ ¼ get myü¾ ¼ thumb upü¾ ¼ here. Holy bum-!"

"LARRY","Uh. Hey, kids, could you just open the door so I can get back to my family? Thanks. Arrrggh! Leslie. It's me, Larry.  Your husband? Think hard, Leslie. We used to be together, for over eight years? That was me! So youü¾ ¼ remarried. Larry! Didn't anybody send out a search party? Please, Leslie, I don't know where else to go. I'm confused. You're Leslie. I'm sorry, too. I'll leave you alone. Eight and thirteen? I can't live in your time. I'm freezing myself again. Tell me about it. I've been doing this for over three and a half hours now, and only my toes are starting to ice over. What is that? Home. They're coming for me! Okay, boys. Thanks. I got my ticket. I have to go to Platform B. Well, this is it. I'm going back to my time. Thanks again, boys. You boys have really shown me the true meanng of friendship. You didn't care about anythng but my happiness. You put me in front of yourselves, and that's what real friendship is all about. After being frozen, I've learned that all a person has in life is family. And friends. If you lose those, you have nothing. So friends are to be treasured, more than anything in the world! Goodbye, boys. Goodbye, friends! Oh, poo! Huh?  Whah?! I've got you pinned. I win. Nooo! Oohh! Good-bye again! I'm off to Des Moines! I'm not living here! Living is having ups and downs and sharing them with friends!  Thank you, Stan and Kyle! See ya! He-e-ey George! What's gon' on? Oh well, I'm sorry, but we can't buy those from you now. I'm afraid the government has just put a ban on stem-cell research. Too many people were upset about using aborted fetal tissue for a study. It's too bad, too. We really coulda helped a lot of people. This is where the bulk of our research was being done. But due to the government ban, we're mostly just packing things up. Look, you have trillions of cells in your body: heart cells, skin cells, brain cells, and so on. But before a cell is designated as a toenail cell or a pancreas cell, it's what we call a stem cell. Sort of like a black cell. Do you understand? Because these cells are blanks, they will often program themselves based on what cells you put around them. You see this rat? Earlier this year, we surgically removed the middle of her spine. then we injected her with some stem cells and... they became the mising part of the spine. Nerve cells damaged by Parkinson's disease or heart tissue of cardiac patients might ultimately be replaced by tissue grown from stem cells. That's the theory. Well, no. To build another Shake's it would be better to use lumber. But, unfortunately, the government has banned stem cell research and so... we'll never know. Where are you going? Hey kid.  Give 'em hell. Give 'em hell. Oh, hey kid.  Good luck. Good luck."

In the meantime we'd like to show you a complimentary film."
"CHOIR TEACHER","Uh. Thank you, Mr. Garrison.  How are we all doing today?!  I can't hear you! I said, How are we all doing?! Children, we are a national choir called, ""Getting Gay With Kids!"" We're gonna do a big tour down in Central America to help save the rainforest, and you can be a part of it! You see, we take kids from all over the country and put them in a choir where we sing and dance to raise awareness about our vanishing rainforest. So, who wants to join the fun?? Excuse me? Well, uh, that's all, really.  So, if anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest and joining our choir, I'll leave information packets up front. Oh, nonono. The rainforest is very fragile. We must take only pictures and leave only footprints. Okay, children, that's all of us. We're ready to head for the Latin American nation of Costa Rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest. And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures. Well, I'm gonna change the way you think, kiddo. Oh, look, children! I think we're entering San Josü¾¼, which is the capital of Costa Rica.  Oh! This is so exciting! Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S. Eric, sit down! Eric, SIT DOWN! Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capitol building. This is where all the leaders of the Costa Rican government make their- All right, that does it!  Eric Cartman, you respect other cultures this instant! You may think that making fun of Third-World countries is funny, but let me- Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President? Because I'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do. Well, it was a long trip, but the children are very excited to sing tomorrow. Uh, we're, uh, we're the choir? That, that was sent from... the United States? We're the group singing for the ""Save The Rainforest"" summit tomorrow?  Oh dear, where's, where's Mr. Mackey? He should have been here by now.  Children, do any of you speak Spanish?  Don't you dare! Ogh! Thank goodness you're here; I don't speak any Spanish. Yeess! Oh boy! Mr. Presidente, round up your subjects outside. We have a special gift for you. The gift... uh-of song. All right, children, Let's get in our rows quickly, so we can begin. Hello, everybody. This is just a little rehearsal for tomorrow, so we may be a little rusty. Great job, gang! You were really all over the place, Kyle. Oh, it's everything I ever dreamed it would be! Eric, what the heck are you doing?? Eric, for God's sake, knock it off!! Well, Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour, but I guess we should be getting back. We have a big concert tomorrow, Don't we, kids?! The Yanogapa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-! Stanley, what is it? Oh my God!! Jesus Christ, is he dead?! Oh, no! God, no, no!  Don't panic, children Maybe we came from that way.  No, nno. Let's try this way. Oh, children, the sun is setting. We have to find our way out of here quick! Whoa-kay, okay, everything is just fine, kids. Now it is important that we all stick together. Is everybody still here? Who's not?! No, you didn't just see Tony Danza, Stanley. Don't worry, Kelly. We're gonna find our way out of the rainforest and make it back to the concert in time. We just need to respect our mother rainforest so that she will respect us."
"CHOIR BOY","Did you know over 10,000 acres of rainforest are bolldozed every year? Did you know that right now, bulldozers are tearing down thousands of acres of rainforest every day? I wish we could have seen the Yanogapa. Wow, look at the pretty flower."
"CHOIR GIRL","That's right. And over 30% of the world's oxygen  is made in the rainforest. My name's Kelly. Now, we've got a looong trip ahead of us, so let's take the opportunity to learn our choreography."
"CRAIG","I know. ...I don't know. No. No I didn't. No. No. He did? Why would he say that? Well, I've gotta go over there and- Okay. Red Racer's on. I do watch Red Racer every day of the week! Nnope. What?! What did he say about Stripe?! That son of a bitch, I'll kill him! After Red Racer. Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow. Some kid. Yeah, don't just ""Oh"" me! What do we do? I've never been in a fight before. Meatloaf? Oh, Jesus! I can't take it! Stop! How can I resist an ass so great? This ass is umlike any I've encountered, Master. Okay. Okay, okay! Respect my authority. Ugh. What was on the news? Huh? This girl touched my thigh. Um.  Okay. I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incinerate me. Incriminate. Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball. Just get out of the hamster ball, or else you're gonna find out! Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo! Enjoying your lunch, nerdo? Get him! Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole. That's the point, buttpipe. Hey, there he is! There's the home-schooled kid!  Come on! Let's go duct-tape him to the flagpole! Oh my God! No! He's my friend! Thanks, Tom. It is indeed four days until the new millennium, and hundreds if not thousands of people have come from all over the world seeking Jesus, here at his house in South Park.  Everyone is giddy with anticipation for Jesus to come out, because as we all know, if Jesus comes out of his house and is not scared by his shadow, it means the next thousand years will be full of peace and love.  Oh, it looks like Jesus might be coming out! Everyone is quiet here, Tom. Looks like the little fellow's a bit nervous. But he has taken another step out, Tom! This is great new for us! ...Well, it's... the millennium, Jesus. Well, it's ""The Millennium"" ...I don't know. Tom, it looked for a second as if Jesus was going to come out of his house, but then he went back inside. But meanwhile, more and more people are showing up to show their support for Jesus. Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas, where tomorrow night THE New Year's Eve event is going to happen. Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, is presenting Rod Stewart, the undisputed King of Pop, right here at this hotel behind me.  It looks as though Jesus really has come through. Everyone is very excited, because rumor has it that God Himself is gonna show up to the event. How about you, ma'am? Do you think God is gonna show up tomorrow night? Well, Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas in what is quickly becoming known as ""the gayest party ever."" Everyone is so outraged that they are building a large cross in which to once again crucify our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. No you don't! What? You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove? This is the end of Smiley Town. The only phone is somehwere in Treasure Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna have to cross the white line. Hell no! I'm not crossing the white line. Craig. It's Spaceman Craig. Take that, kindergartners! Kindergartners. Treasure Cove is full of them. I got new orders. I'm supposed to take you to see the mayor. ...Come on, we wanna see the ass people. Don't you have a VHS of it? Ha, that guy's a pussy. Oh, aaaah, well you guys are dumb. What's going on? Oh. I don't know. Why? Yeah. It kinda does. Urh urh urh! That's true, huh? Man, that makes me really reflect on my pet. Well, yeah, but Wendy, you have to admit, Bebe's a lot smarter and more organized than you. Yeah! Sure is! Hah hah hahah hah! Have you guys noticed that Bebe isn't as cool as she used to be? I'm sorry for fighting, you guys. It could hold a mental spell of some kind. You're too young. Only the six of us are to go? Look out! We're entering the limits of Bailey. Everyone stay close. What? That's stupid. Whatever. I'm going back to play with the Harry Potter kids. Yeah, didn't you see that commercial where it says that if you have pot you could become a terrorist? You guys look pretty gay. Not as gay as us, though. Oh yeah?! We're superduper triple-dog gay! Maybe. But you'll never be as metrosexual as us! Come on, fags! HA! Told you you guys were straight! I'm not just gay, I'm a catamite. Hey, butch boy. Nice football you got there. Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend! Take your non-flaming ass to some other school! Everyone knows it's true! Is so! Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are. Yeah, little bitch! Where'd you get those? Uh, uh, they're not that cool. Aha!  There you are! You guys thought you were sooo cool, didn't you?! Well look at what we got! At first we needed our parents' permission, but then we told him our parents were dead. So,  how would you ninjas like to do battle? You can't pass through this area until you defend your honor! I am not Craig,  I am Ginza,  with the powerful blade of the kitana. Iya! Lose who? Stuck in his eye? Was he bleeding? Oh shit, you guys are in trouble. We're outta here! The hell with that! Butters! Butters! Butters! Where the hell are you?! You guys!  You guys! It's Butters! We saw 'im! Right on the other side of the fairgrounds. He's just wandering around aimlessly. Butters is right on the other side. No way. I believe in Mr. Jefferson. Yeah! Oh hey guys. Heard about your news show being cancelled. Yeah, well, I've got an overall deal with the school, heh. They're paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows. This much more than you had!  Hey, a round of root beers for everyone! On me! Hey gang, I brought the new episode of wide angle close-up animals. You wanted to see me, Mr. Meryl? I wouldn't if I were you. Can't believe it. Not all that bad?? How could you say that?! You hate this game more than any of us! All the other teams are worse than us. But who? He's perfect. Hey, I hate Cartman too. Can I ignore him with you? It's occupied."

No. See, if I start to like you too much,  I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country.  Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again.  And that would devastate me. So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny! Benny, will you hold my hand?  I don't want to get emotionally attached, though. We are? Me, too! I wanna go home!  I hate the rainforest! Oh Lenny, hold me.  No, I can't get attached.  Oh, but I do like you. Oh, but you're only going to leave me. Aaaaa! Lenny! Larry, if we make it out of this, I want to be your girlfriend. Even if we do live in different places, I don't care! Oh no, that big thing is going to make love to Miss Stevens! Okay, Benny. So in order for our long-distance relationship to work, we'll have to call each other every other day. Aaaah! Lenny! No! Whah?? Who?! Who killed him?! Who's ""they""?!

"THOMAS","It stood above us looking down with these big red eyes,- -and I yelled. I said, ""What do you want from us, monster?!"" And the monster bent down and said, ""...Uh I need about tree-fitty."" Three dollars and fifty cents. That's right. I said ""I ain't giving you no tree-fitty you goddamn Loch Ness monster! Get your own goddamn money!"" She gave him a dollar. Well of course he's not gonna go away, Nellie! You gave him a dollar, he's gonna assume you got more! And that was the third time we saw the Loch Ness monster. Then one time, I believe it was July- -August. There's a knock on the door. I open it, and there's this cute little girl scout- -And she says to me, ""How would you like to buy some cookies?"" And I said ""Well, what kind do you have?"" She had thin mints, graham crunchy things- -Raisin oatmeal, and I said ""We'll take a graham crunch. How much will that be?"" And she looks at me and she says, ""...Uh I need about tree-fitty."" Well, it was about that time that I notice that girl scout was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era. I said, ""Dammit monster! Get off my lawn! I ain't giving you no tree-fitty!"" It said, ""how about just two-fitty?"" I said, ""Oh, now it's only two-fitty!! What?! Is there a sale on Loch Ness munchies or something?!"" Damn right, I was angry! Aah, shut your mouth, woman! Sure. That crazy old monster  Now, then the fourth time I saw the... Could I have your attention please? Tomorrow, my son is gonna get married to a beautiful lady.  I'm very happy for them both.  Ooh there I go! I told myself I wasn't gonna cry, now. Oh, I remember when Chef was just a three-year-old little man. He came running up to me with a big smile and his little chef's hat on, and he said, ""Poppa, poppa!"" I said ""What do you need, Chef, my boy?"", and he said, ""...I need about tree-fitty."" Well, it was about that time I got suspicious. I said, ""Chef, why do you need tree-fitty?"" He said, ""My imaginary friend Goo-Goo the dinosaur wants it."" I went to my son's room, and sure enough, there was the Loch Ness monster! I said, ""Dammit monster! You stop bugging my children now! We work for our money in this house and we don't give money away!"" So I chased the monster down the street, you see... ...And then these aliens had me up on their ship, right? They was probing me and all that. Don't matter what we had for dinner woman! Now this alien had a big head and big black eyes, and it was all bent over me. I said, ""What do you want from me, alien?!"" and do you know what he said? Uh. Let me tell the damn story now! He said, ""tree-fitty."" And so I realized I that it wasn't no alien, it was that God-damned Loch Ness monster again, trying to trick me into giving him tree-fitty by dressing up like an alien. Don't that just beat all?! What?! You gave that monster another damn tree-fitty?! Well no wonder the damn monster keeps coming back to our house! You keep giving it tree-fitty! She's a goddam Succubus! Hold on, now, I'll see if I have tree-fitty! This is ridiculous, havin' to sit out here waitin' to find out if our priest molested our kids. Well come on in out of the cold now.

In the name of all that is holy we command this spirit be set free! There we go! We're gettin' somethin' now! Come on out hyow! It's safe!  Here it comes! The spirit is comin' out hyuh! Well hold on the potatoes two seconds, woman!  The soul's comin' out hyuh! It's almost done. Alright, son. Now bring me the victim child! Yeah. You know, the child that we sacrifice so we could Kenny's soul into its body. God-damnit! The spirit's out and it don't have no where to go! Well come on, the soul's in here! It can't escape now.  It's goin' to the light! Unfortunately, it's the livin' room light. Go on now, soul now! Now don't go offerin' the soul no tree-fiddy, woman!

He's at the 50, the 40, the 30,... He breaks another tackle, and the ball is loose! It all comes down to this! South Park is just one pitch away from being State Champions.  Oh geez, it looks like two parents are fighting. They'd better be careful. The Little League has a no-tolerance policy."

"MR. ADLER","Wrong! You are here because you are America's future!  You may someday be doctors, or lawyers, or scientists. Most of you, however, will be pumping gas, or cutting sheet metal, and that's why we have...  shop class. Now, let me make one thing crystal clear: I don't like kids that screw around! You screw around in shop class, you can lose a hand or an eye. I have a- I have... uh, I have a... Huh? Oh, uh, I was just saying that I want to know who is the biggest troublemaker in your class? That true, Craig? You a troublemaker? Well, you'd better not be, because in shop class we-  Hey! Did you just flip me off?! Yes, you did! Hey! Don't screw around! You screw around too much! Huhuh Huh? Stop screwing around! Well, uh, well, sure. Uh, class dismissed. Well, that was fun, Pearl. See you later. Why? Oh, well, uuh, I can't. I left the oven on. I just... I can't. Oh, I know. I have genital warts. Nope. Sorry. Maybe some other time. Haaarrr!  Aw, God, what am I gonna do? Hey, quit screwing around back there! You're horsing! Huh? Uh, what? The belt sander? Tommy?? I told you not to screw around with the belt sander, didn't I?  Well go on. Go see the nurse; she'll give you some peroxide. Huh? Oh, this is a woman I knew a long time ago. What? Hey! Go on!  You're screwing around in here! No. No. Make it stop. Baaaaa!  I never got to say good-bye. I never got to say good-bye!  Oh no! Oh NO! NOW what do I do?! Good-bye, cruel world.  Jesus Christ!

Wow, you're all alive again! Thank you. Thank you for freeing me. I feel like now I can move on. Baby, I feel so much better. I feel so alive. Thank you, baby. Thank you. I have to agree with Ms. Choksondik. It's our responsibility to make sure our kids are safe if they're gonna screw around."
"TOKEN","Yeah, they left. What the-? Damn, baby. That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster! Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are sure to win! Oh! No. Yeah. Yeah. If somebody kills somebody, it's a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it's a hate crime. And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing. ""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocracy."" What are we gonna do?! Come on! Hurry up!  Hey, what are you guys doin'? Yeah, a turkey that could do tricks. Yeah, that turkey sucks. But what are we gonna do? Six! How do they eat? Using my laptop computer, I hooked into the Internet and found a meteorology Web site.  I donwloaded the data, and with my dad's video projector, I can show you the graph I made of predictable weather patterns over the next three months. I also printed out the results on my color printer. Here you are, Ms. Choksondik. Alright! My family isn't rich. But I... Mom? Dad? Why do we have a bigger house than everybody else in South Park? I know. But why? All the kids at school made fun of me today because I'm rich. I don't wanna be rich anymore! I wanna eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and, and and wear clothes from J mart! I just wanna be like all the other kids in South Park. Please, Mom and Dad, please. I'm sure. That's not a blinding device, Dad. It's flourescent lighting. Come on!  Hey look: there pants are only five bucks apiece. They must really suck. What do ya think? It doesn't matter, Mom. They're poor people pants. Hey you guys. Yeah, well, you know, I did a little shopping at J mart. Here you go. It's a DVD of the Lion King I only have this. What's a VHS? Why can't I be like all the other kids? Hi! Welcome to the neighborhood! I'm Token. Aah, he's a lawyer. I think. All right!  Thanks, God. ...And this is the room where my mom and dad keep their original v-Van Gogh painting. You do? God, that's great! I'm just so happy you guys moved into town. You see, I used to be the only rich kid. All the other families here are kinda  low to  middle-income. Well, they never really had any money. Well I... think that.. they... ...That's ...great. Hi. Wow, my plan to get rich people here sure did work. Hey, I got a great idea! Let's all pack some lunches and go sledding. Oh. Alright then. Well, yeah, but can't we just play without these uncomfortable uniforms? This game is too confusing. How about we have a snowball fight? I don't fit in anywhere. Hello, my name is Token. I don't fit in with all the kids at South Park Elementary so, I invited a bunch of rich kids to move to town. The problem is, I don't fit in with them, either. That's why I've come to live with you.  So if you'll have me and raise me as one of your own, I promise to be the best lion I could be.  Uuuh, yeah. RRrrr!! Roar! You- you talked. I, I understood you. I must be becoming a lion! Who's Aslan? Are... you... Aslan? Well, I'm Token Yes. Um. Great Aslan. I don't fit in anywhere else. Well, I don't know. What? ...I like jokes a lot. So can I stay? Huuuunh  Aslan. ...I thnk I'm gonna go home now. They do. But, I guess I learned something today. You see, even though kids at South Park make fun of me, I still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or, lions. Even though I may be different from them, I still like my old friends best. ...No thanks. No, because there's a spring in there, and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna hurt my finger. Ow. Jesus, lions suck! Hey guys. You mean, you want me around? Yeah, I know. But you guys always rip on me for bein' rich. That's right, huh? You're right, guys. From now on, I'm fine with being made fun of for being rich. You're not? Wait! I liked being ripped on for being rich better! All right! Well, what am I supposed to do? Aaaah. Oh, I know. I was just thinking the same thing. It's like, she's a girl, but, she's someone you could hang out with. I'm gonna start saying that now. Here comes a sedan. ""If I could be Bebe.""  ""If I was Bebe I would have lots of friends because I would be sooo great. I would make people smile and think wherever I went."" Yeah. We need a leader like Bebe. She can teach us all so much. Yeah. What the hell happened to us? I am not scared. I'll go inside and watch the tape,  just for a few seconds. If I do not return in two minutes, send a party in after me.  The fate of Middle Earth... is in my hands. I'm not playing anymore. I don't know, I don't wanna know. I'm out. ...And when the woman has four penises in her at the same time, then stands over the men and pees on them, is that part of being in love too?  Five midgets, spanking a man... covered in Thousand Island dressing. Is that making love? How do you know? None of us had ever had any drugs before. When was the last guy you had a manicure, straight man? What?! We don't have a bass guitar. Hey, there was a bass guitar in my basement. So, what are we doing? I'm out. I don't know how to play bass. I'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes! God-damnit! Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here? This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby! What did you say?! Why the hell would I be looking way over there?? Cartman, what the hell is all this? But you spent all the money we made! Yeah. You're gonna hurt the band. What?! How did that happen? Whoa! Where'd you get those?? And I am Black Taku,  with the power of perfect spelling! Butters! Butters! Jimmy and Eric, it looks like a massive snow storm is headed South Park's way. I asked my dad last night and he said that he heard the snow storm is expected on Tuesday. Guys? Wow, those animals are pretty cute. Action News. Yeah! We should make up a bunch of reports about how dangerous it is to be alive. Huh? No tornadoes, Eric, but interestingly enough, there is a low-pressure storm moving in over the Park County Valley. Should bring us some chilly days ahead. Uh oh, looks like it's Panda Bear Madness Minute! That is a terrific idea, Stan, A-Okay. We did that! Cough medicine? Yeah. It was great. The cough companies claim they don't intend for their product to be used by kids to get high! But one look at the packaging tells otherwise.  Theradryl DM. For kids.  Dexa Cough, children's formula. Those wings don't look very strong. There has to be another way! Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years of darkness or not? Nothin' Yeah. I'm supposed to be home by 3:30. ...Yeah? We were at why I should give you ten percent. Well, I guess that makes sense. All right. You'll never find... Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, baby ... (you're gonna miss my lovin') Here you go. Thanks. Are you serious?? Oh my God! Okay! Oh, come on, guys. You have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me. Send a cress in your plates, folks? Oh... Hey guys.  What, what are you doin' here? Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.  I'm trying to work my way back home. No! Ignoring him? How come? Oh yeah."
"RICHARD","How was school today, son? That's great. Son, let me tell you a little story about when your mother and I first met. You see, a long time ago, there were a lot of guys who were after your mother. She used to be very attractive. Well, when I started courting your mother, there was this big muscular football player named Quib, who didn't take too kindly to me. He wanted your mother all to himself. And so, one day, he challenged me to a fight. Oh'd. I, I don't know. He moved away or something. Richarrrrd! 'Oodleahah. Tweek, calm down. Have some coffee. We can let them go, can we? Well, sure, that's easy for you to say; your son's dead. But those of us with alive children need to be sure that Father Maxi's on the up-and-up. Uh, Sh-sh. Here he comes, here he comes. That's a good idea. I'm gonna be an atheist too. You too, Tweek! Atheism has definitely made our lives better. Oh thanks, Sharon. That's true. If I'm gonna raise my son to be atheist, I don't want him saying ""under God"" every day at school. That could really damage him. ""Under God"" should be taken out of the- uh, 'scuse me.  Moowwaaagh.  ""Under God"" should be taken out of the Pledge of Allegiance. Come on, Tweek! We're gonna watch it on TV! ...What was that last bit? Tweek! Calm down, son. Remember what Dr. Norris told you. Find your center. Sit down and have some coffee, son. Tweek, there's starting to be a lot of reports in the news about kids being abducted, and we thought we should talk. Now, we don't want to alarm you, son, but we've isntalled new locks on your bedroom windows and door. Important for you to know never to unlock them at night for anyone except your mother and I. You failed the test, son. Didn't I tell you not to open the door for anybody except your mother and I? He would have sprayed your brains all over the floor and then taken your body off to the woods.  You've got to be on your toes, Tweek. Alright, now go to bed and get some rest. Did he hurt you, son? That's... not a bad idea, a city wall. Alright, Cows, We're gonna go out there and we're gonna give 'em hell! Well, we've... put a wall around the city to keep outsiders out. You don't think we want a bunch of strangers coming in to play ball, do you? Guys! Sh, quiet everyone. Well, if you'll all excuse us, I think we'll be going now. 'Sokay, boys. Just act as if we weren't here. Well, maybe things could be better if we could trust people like the Stotches! Oh yeah?! Oh Jesus, turn it up, honey! Where are you going? Oh??  I think I'll go with you. I just want to make sure that you- Me?? I would never abduct our son! Well what are we supposed to do, eh-? How can we protect Tweek from ourselves? Wait a minute. Those Mongolians are... our children. Oh God. What have we done? We sent our children away, and now they don't even remember who they are. They're starting to remember. We're sorry, Tweek! Oh my God, do you see what this means? The Ghost of Human Kindness was right all along. The uh... no no, the part about being more trusting. We should follow what he said, not what he did. Get out of here! How about some shirazz, guys? My pleasure, silly-buns. Why? Wohohoho, goodness no. I, I'm straight. Oh my God! Boy, you really beat the crap out of that Conifer dad."
"PEARL","Richard, aren't you going to invite me in? Well, I thought maybe you would at least at-tempt to make love to me tonight. Oh, Richard, why can't you open your heart to me? Why? We'll use plastic wrap. On your first date, look at the man's shoes. Sometimes you can tell how much money a man has just by his shoes. When he takes you out to dinner, try to sneak a peek at his wallet while he pays for you. If he only has one credit card, BEWARE.  It means he doesn't spend a lot, and worse yet, it could be a debit card. If he has more than four credit cards, that's a little fishy. The perfect number of credit cards for a man to have is... two. Dump that zero and get yourself a hero! He could be earning that degree all his life while you starve to death with two dying babies sucking at your teats. Okay, that was very good, class. Now let's try this one together.  Honey, can I get a new wardrobe? All right, now let's try this one together. Lisa Smith's husbamd just bought HER a new car.... Good. Bebe, why don't you try this one. I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life. Outstanding! Now, Kenny, how about you try?  I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed. O-kay. Kenny, could I talk to you over here real quick? Kenny, I don't know quite how to tell you this, but... I'm not sure home economics is right for you. Well, your cooking is unsatisfactory, your sewing skills are below average, and, frankly, I don't think the odds of you marrying a nice rich man in the future are very, well, good. No. I think you should consider transfering to shop class. Now, now. Very few students are severely innured in a shop class. Fight? Oh no no no, girls! Haven't I taught you anything?"

"PETEY"," PETEY Did you know that when one little panda pulls on another little panda's underwear, that's sexual harassment? That makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda And when one little panda puts his furry little willy in another panda's ear, that makes me a very sad panda. Now, I'm going to pass out these booklets, and we're going to go through each and every sexual harassment law. ""...Article 36, Section 19: One panda may not make sexual comments about another panda's appearance. If said panda does make..."" Uh-oh. That's right, he can. ""The first party of the first panda may sue the second-party panda unless that panda was said panda aforementioned panda.""  PETEY Well, when one little panda asks another little panda to perform oral sex, that is sexual harassment. I'm afraid the law states that the school must be held responsible. Panda. Hello, sexual harassment cubs. Who? Oh, all right. I'm a sa-a-a-a-ad panda. It's because I'm a panda, isn't it? I can't help what I am. Well, yes, but that place is for loser mascots that make no sense. I don't have to sit here and listen to this! How would you like a big panda punch in your puss?! It's okay. I get it. There's no room in the world for pandas. Well, you don't have to worry about me! I'm off to the Island of Misfit Mascots! Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree? Why? Seems all I do now is cause trouble. But, I'm just a panda. What message? ...You know? You little cubs might just be right. Okay! Hello, everyone. I'm Petey, the ""Don't Sue People"" Panda. Listen to me: when you sue somebody, it hurts everyone. You sue for money, but where do you think that money comes from? From the schools, from taxes, from the state. From you.  There's no such thing as free money. When you sue somebody, you take money away from parks and schools and charities, and put it in your own pocket. And that makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda. ""Don't Sue People"" Panda. Pandas love ice cream."
"JUDGE JULIE","This is Cartman vs. Marsh, Case No. 3433. What is your complaint, Mr. Cartman? All right. Let's move this along, shall we? Now, Eric Cartman, uh, you claim that Stan Marsh sexually harassed you in school. Mr. Marsh, what do you have to say? I need to hear your defense. All right, this seems pretty open-and-shut. Stan Marsh, under the new Sexual Harassment in Schools law, I am forced to find you guilty. Since the defendant is under age and has no monetary resources, it is the judgment of this court that 50% of Stan Marsh's belongings are to be handed over to Eric Cartman immediately. Answer the question. Did you know that sexual harassment was going on in the classroom? You are the witness here, Mr. Garrison, not Mr. Hat. Mr. Garrison, I will remind you that we are in court! After careful review, it is the judgment of this court that South Park Elementary pays Eric Theodore Cartman $1.3 million in damages. Eric Cartman, it is the judgment of this court that you sexually harassed Pip Philip at school. You asked Pip to suck your... you know what. You must give Pip half your stuff, and the school must give Pip $1.6 million. Next! Half her belongings, school is sued for 2.1 million. Next! Half his stuff, 2 million from the school. This is Case No. 47g, Everyone vs. Everyone. Representing the side of Everyone is Gerald Broflovski. Well, seeing as we have no lawyers, I'm throwing the case out! Case dismissed!"

"CHAIRMAN","All right, what other cuts do we have to make to the school budget? Oh, right. We certainly can't afford him anymore. Mr. Garrison, after very careful review the school board believes that you should take a... hiatus from teaching. Indefinitely. Did you know that not one of your students knew who Sam Adams was? ...Frankly, Mr. Garrison, it isn't even your educational record that we're most concerned about.  It's your somewhat substantial police record. We're sorry, Mr. Garrison, we have no choice. Mr. Garrison, most teachers do not carry a gun!"
"MR. EVANS","Uh uh, have a seat, Mr. Morris. Uh. S-Sexual Harassment Panda. Uh. M-m-m-Mr. Morris, we at the school board have been thinking, and, we've decided that perhaps a ""panda"" isn't the best way to explain sexual harassment to children. ...I'm afraid we're just going to have to let you go. That's thrity-two more lawsuits in the past twenty-four hours. Looks like we'll have to cut all counseling and nutrition programs. Holy smokes, you're right! Ugh!  P-please! Don't sue us. Oh! Well, uh... We had to let him go. D'uh. I mean, he left. Enough, enough!  Look, it's obvious we have a lot of emotional issues and personal demons to face here. During your prison time, you will all be spending one hour a day in therapy here with me. What I want you to do is learn to control those sick, sexual urges you have. Now we're gonna try an exercise: I'm gonna confront you with vwhat you lust after most.  Alright parents, now I, I know this is difficult, but I want you to just look at this child. Just try to suppress your urges to rape him. Just think about somethin' else. Think about clouds and beaches. Don't think about his supple, soft little body. Fight your urges, Mr. Broflovski! I can't help you if you won't admit you need help!! Now sit down!  Look, I know this is very difficult for all of you. Most of you are still in denial about what you've done! To you it seems you've never raped your children at all! But you did. Help meeee help youuuu. Now let's try again.  Look at this young man. Just look. Don't rape. Fight it. Fight it! Okay, so what are some other things that we can do besides molest our children? Sure, ""see a movie""'s good.  We could see a movie instead of molesting our children. What else? Uh huh. I'll put ah, ""knitting, sewing."" Who's got another one? Nonono, we're looking for things to do besides molesting our children. Fishing's good. Uh huh."
"COMPANY REP","Well. Uh, your credentials are very impressive, and you do seem to have a lot of ambition, uh but I'm afraid there's no room for you at our comapany at this time. Well, ih it is because you're a panda. Euh, it's because you're a sexual harassment panda. Now, have you ever heard of a retreat called ""The Island of Misfit Mascots?"" Well, uh, yes.

"SKEETER","NO!  I wanna know som'in' from Mr. Panda Bear here! If you pandas are from mountainous areas of China and Tibet, how come you eat bamboo, which is prone to grow only in drier, more arid regions?! Hey! Eight-year old! We don't take kindly to your types in here! NO!  I wanna know som'in' from Mr. I'm Eight Years Old here! How come you types are always wearin' them funny padded shirts in the winter?! We don't take kindly to panda bears! Whoa! Look at her!  Hey! Beautiful woman! We don't take kindly to your types around here! Hey! We don't take kindly to folks that don't sue people 'round here! Hey! We don't take too kindly to cases being dismissed around here! Llet's get him! You know, boys emulate authority figures. Even if it doesn't turn them gay, they could end up all talk and all femmit, prancin' around like girls. They're gonna be sending their kids to our schools, and mixin' them with our pure, non-rich kids! Damn, I hate those stupid richers! They've got nice expensive beers for you across the street at the new Wolfgang Puck's. I think we scared 'im. If they get that petition passed, it's all over. They won, Garrison. They can't be scared out of town. It's working! That was it. We just saw the last of them speeding away in a van! Get him! Oh boy, do I feel stupid. Aha-  ...Hey. We're all laughing. Eh- Excuse me? Yeah. Free Hat. Oh. Sorry. Um, come on, everyone, guess we're in the wrong place. Can't we also work towards freeing Hat? Yeah! We should go get that negative as soon as we get Hat free! Hat was attacked maliciously and unprovoked by a gang of babies in West Town Park. When that many babies get together they can be like piranha. He's right. We'd better split up. Some of you go with the boys and get those film prints, the rest of us come with me to go talk to the governor about freeing Hat. But the governor won't pardon Hat. So how can we get him out of prison? No? There's a man in prison and his name is Hat. Sure. Give that man a baby! Hey all you unAmerican bastards! If you don't like America, why don't you git out?! Foundin' Fathers would kick all your asses! There! All finished. From now on, this is the pro-war side of town, and that's the unpatriotic side. Hey everybody, this is never going to work. Don't you see? All this dividin' up the town, it's just ridiculous. What we really should be doing, is just beatin' the hell out of each other like we were. That's bullcrap, Mayor! Our rally to support the war was set up months ago! Hey, if you don't like America, then you can git out! We'll trizzle the shizzle all over the hizzle! See? I told you they had your son. Yeah! Don't kid yourselves. These people have come out to support our troops, right?! Oh no you don't! We're doing our pro-war song first! Well excuse me if... I'm a little for supportin' our troops. I believe freedom isn't free. We must defend our country.  SKEETER We got GPS, ICBMs, and good old-fashioned lead. That's because the Founding Fathers would have supported the war! Yeah, but... if it weren't for all you guys protesting, why everyone around the world would hate the American people instead of just the President. Hey I'm a little bit country I'll be the muscle of America Just because a guy cares about how he looks and is in touch with his feminine side doesn't mean he's gay anymore. 'Sokay, Mr. Garrison. We learned that gays are totally cool. You're just one of us now. Put it out! Put it out! The heat could really damage our hair. We'd better let the police handle this! Eeeek! Not only that, the auction was televised on public access, so my little daughter watchin' at home saw the -penis! How am I suppsoed to explain that to her?! What happened to him, Doctor? Are you kiddin'? Stan is probably ready to pounce on them after what they did to his father! Woo! You bureaucrats have no right to play God and take that tube out!"

See ya tomorrow at the bake sale, fellas. Wow, what a great audience. I just flew into South Park. Boy, are my crutches tired!  What a terrific audience. You know, sometimes people ask me, ""Are you angry at God for making disabled people?"" I say, ""No, I think the world is better with puh-President Bush."" Well, I sure have met a lot of interesting people here in South Park.  Hhh-how about that Eric Cartman kid, huh? ""Goddamnit! God-. No, Kitty, that's my mud pie! Goddamnit! Eh, Goddamnit!"" And how about that school counselor? ""Uh, dr-, drugs are b-bad.""  ""Uh. Drugs are bad, okay? Uh, drugs are, drugs are bad, okay? Okay?""  Wow, what a great audience. ""Mr. Hat. Be queit, Mr. Hat. Mr.-""  ""Hello there, children. Mr. Hat. Hello- Mr. Hat""  ""I'm making Salisbury steak for lunch.""  ""Salisbury steak for lunch."" Eb. Uh. ""Goddamnit, Goddamnit!"" And of course, my very favorite, ""Timmy! Huh. Timmy! Uh liv-, uh, living a lie! Uh living a lie, Timmy!""  ""Ti- Timmy, uh living a lie. Heh, heh. Eh Tih- ahah Timmy."" Heh. Sometimes it's like, ""Please, Timmy, learn a new word,"" heh. ""Timmy! Tu-Timmy!"" Wow, looks like when it comes to comedy, I really t-take the c-keh-c. I really take the cay. I really take the k-keh cake. Oh, hey Timmy. I'm glad you called, very much. I've been detecting some a-animosity towards me lately, and I was hoping we could bury the hatchet. What's that? A present? You got me a p-present? ... Gee, you didn't have to do that. I mean, I understand why you've been jealous of my talent.  If you work at it, maybe you could be as... handi-capable as I am, huh?  Wow, a parka.  You-you didn't have to do that, Tim-Tim. Oh, sure. I'll see if it fits.  This is very warm. Thanks a lot, Tim-Tim. Well, I'll see you around. Thanks again, Tim-Tim. And so I said to him, ""Hey, ah-I may be handicapped, bu-but I'm not... deaf."" Wow, what a terrific audience. Well, for my next joke I'm gonna need a vo-volunteer from the audience, very much. How about you, Timmy? Sure, come on up here, Tim-Tim.  Timmy, ladies and gentlemen. Let's give him a hand, very much. Come to think of it, give him a pair of legs, too.  Here, Timmy, put on this silly hat.  Just for a second, Timmy.  Don't be a jerk, Timmy.  Hey, don't push me! Well then that settles it! Fellas, what we're gonna hafta do is try to ch... change the Scouts' rules, very much. Wow, what a great audience. For my first joke, I'm going to need a... volunteer. Come on up here, Tim-Tim.  Timmy, when I tell you to do something, you do it! Timmy, don't make me k... kick you ass! Put on the hat! Pu-put it on!! Not this year. Coem on. Come on! Come on! Man. Huah! Come on! No!  Ow! Timmy? Timmy? Well, Timmy, I guess we learned an important lesson, too, very much. There is room for more than one handi-capable person in Scouts. I'm glad we're best friends now. See ya at Scouts. Yes? Out of Scouts? Well, hello, Eric. I was really glad you called me, very much. What's this all about? Gee, that's a terrible thing, Eric. Um comedy can be the best therapy, very much. Oh, I don't think that'll be hard. I've been working on my rr... routine. Okay. Try this one on for size: Why did the... pigeon cross the road? Because it was having sex with the chihi... Because it was having sex with the ch-hi-hi... Because it was having sex with the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch... eh, it was having sex with the ch-ch-hiicken. Wow, what a great audience... How about this classic? Knock-knock. Orange. Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say bbb? Orange you glad I didn't say beh buhuhnnnaana? Wow, w-what a great audience... Knock-knock. An interrupting ca'ow. Moooooo!  ...What a terrific audience.

Boy, isn't this great fellas? Are we great pals or what? Oh boy! Oh thank God! Well, I don't think I did too well in the... bathing suit competition. But I can't wait for the talent show competition. That'll really my chance to... shine.  Wow, what a terrific audience. So anyway, a guy walks into a buh- ...A guy walks into a b- ...buh...

But why is everyone ditching my comedy show to see him?! So then, how come you came? Say, fellas! Thanks a lot for goin' to my ...c-comedy show! I know that, I was being f-f-f-fa...cetious! Ooh, Christopher Reeve! Whoop-de-freakin-do! I put together a comedy show and I was crippled from BIRTH! Can you believe this asswipe, Timmy? Why is a celebrity who became crippled more important than us that were born that way, very much. Hey there fellas. Say, would you guys like to join our club? Oh, I'm sorry. You can't. You aren't crippled. To be in our club, not only do you have to be c-c-crippled, but you have to have been born that way. Do you know what that means? No butthole Superman asswipe Christopher Reeve! Sorry, able-bodied, you can't join. Hey Timmy. How many able-bodied people does it take to screw in a light bulb? One.  You know what you call an able-bodied guy on the doorstep? Whatever his name is. Hello, Mr. McGillicuuhuhuhh... Mr. McGillicuddy. Timmy and I made a ...T-shirt design for our new club.  We just came up with a name this morning. Why not? ...There's already a Crips?! No, we never have. Are they crippled from birth or are they cripple wannabes like Christopher Reeve? Can you believe it, Timmy? All this time there was a group for truly crippled people like ourselves, and we didn't know it. Come on. We have to take the bus to Five Points in Denver. Excuse me, sir.  we're looking for a group of people called the Crips. Do you know where they meet? We've already tried the rec center and the library. Oh, it's okay. We're Crips ourselves. Come on, Tim-Tim. Well hello everyone.  I'm Jim Swanson, and this is my friend Timmy. Well, let us tell you a little bit about ourselves. Timmy and I are both true Crips, born and raised. We're the only Crips in South Park, where we live, and we would love to join your fa-fa-fabtasitc Denver chapter. We just have one question before we join your c-club. Do you think it's better to be born a Crip, or to become a Crip later by accident? I agree. I mean, it's like  ""come on""! Why do these people who become crippled later in life think they're such great pot-potatuhs? Well, we're glad you see it our way, fellas. So can we join your g... group? Well, sure. Tim and I would love to pop some punk-ass Bloods. We're terrific at it. I don't know, Timmy, just play along. Down like a clown, Charlie Br... Down like a clown, Charlie B-broooowww... Down like a clown, Charlie Browh... Bro-uh-own. Down like a clown, Charlie Br-Brown. Say Timmy, did you notice that all the crippled people in that club are negros? That's an amm-mmazing coincidence. I mean, there's not one crippled colored person in South Park. Well hello, officers. We're goin' to pop some punk-ass Bloods. Look, Timmy. There's a convenience store.  That must be what the fellas meant by ""pop some punk-ass Bloods."" They want us to get them some soda pop and treats.  Let's buy them ginger ale and marshmallows. Then they'll let us in the club for sure. Suh, suh, suh, suh, Sssunday driver! So does that mean we can join the c-c...club? Wow, these guys really are crippled. Timmy, I have a feeling that this is the start of something b-b-b-b...b-b-brilliant. Thanks for the ride home, fellas. We sure had a ...terrific time. You dawgs keep it real, too. Well, that sure was a terrific time. Let's go all around tomorrow and show everyone our new outfits, Timmy. Whatup, Mazie? Ye-yo, Pops? No need to worry about me. I'm cool like a fool in a swimming ppp-ppp-pp-pp-pool. Hello. We'd like two orders of Kung ...Pao Chicken, please. What's that? Oh, and one medium lemonade, please. Hunh? Ah- are you sure? Well gee, that's really nice of you, Mr. ...Chinese person.  Look Tim-Tim, we got a cash prize. We must be the ...one hundredth customer or something. Actually, it was a regular lemonade. Gee, thanks a lot. See you next time. Yo, Mamsie. What's up, Pops? A what? Oh, you mean the fellas. Well sure. But I can't talk about the club on account of it's sssuper secret, dawg. Why you be trippin', Mom? I mean  come on. I'm finally a part of something, very much. Yo, don't be dissing my niggaz, dawg. They're my f... friends. Nobody cared about my standup comedy! All that hard work just to be outshined by C-Christopher Reeve the super b-butthole! Right. Because you and Mom used to make fun of crippled kids in high school. Look! My gang, which I can't talk about because it's super secret, is the most important thing to me now! And if you two don't like it, you can just pass the blunt to the nigga on your left. Sixty-five... bottles of... beer on the wall. Six- Jesus Christ!  Holy G...guacamole! Freakin' Frijoles!  Leapin' L-langosta. Any word on who shot up me and Timmy's houses, officer? The... B-Bloods? The-they do?? But... but why do they hate each other? Oh, so you used ssstemm cells like Christopher Reeve? Oh boy, Timmy, we should have never started a gang for people crippled from birth. Now they're at war with the people who are crippled from an accident. Boy were we wrong. Wow, w-we've got to do something, Timmy. We've gotta get the Crips and Bloods to sstop fighting. I bet if we could just get them together... but how? Wu-wait a minute! I've got it! A lock-in at the rec center! We did it for our church once. All we do is rent out the rec center overnight. They lock the doors so nobody can leave, and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk. You get all the Crips you can to the rec center tomorrow night, Timmy. And I'll try to get all the ...Bloods there. This is gonna be t-terrific! Come on in, everybody. Lots of su-surprises and t-treats inside.  Great to see you all. What a terrific audience. We sure do. Thanks, Mr. Apple...b-by. You bet. Oh, we will. It's called a lock-in at the rec center. We can use all the rec center facilities. We can play basketball, go swimming, or even just kick it in the lounge area with some games and ...p-puzzles. But nobody can leave until it's seven a.m., so if you wanna have a good time, you're all just gonna have to learn to get along.  Theeerrre's pizzaaa. Hold it! Don't you see? It doesn't matter if we were crippled from birth, or crippled in an accident. We're all brothers. Look: we hve the whole rec room to ourselves. Can't we all just try having some fun together? Why don't we at least give it a chance? I mean,  Come on! I said, ""I mean,  Come on!"" Come on. Come on. I told you, lock-ins at the rec center always work. And you know, I've learned something, too. I was player-hatin' Christopher Butthole Reeve because he got more attention than me. But just like... y-you guys, I need to learn to control my a... anger. I guess we all learned that trying to get along is way better than p... player hatin'.  The gang wrote a song about it. Why don't we listen in? Well, sure, Eric. W-w-waht seems to be the p-p-p-prrroblem? Well, the best thing is not to act nice, Eric. Uh, the best thing is to be genuinely nice. Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh. The best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorius anti-d- ant'duhh ...antecdote. Well, like, try this one on for size: Knock knock. Ing-mar ...Bergman.  Now you say, ""Ingmar Bergman who?"" Hey Stan. For- Forw- Forw-w-w what? She's what? ...Okay.  Hey uh-Wen, hey wu-Wemdy. Stan says your a cont... you're a- cont- S-Stan says you're a cont- cont- -cont- You're a cont-tinuing source of inspiration to him. She just- w-walked away, Stan. You're gonna have to face facts. It's over. Should I try telling him a fa-fantastic joke? Jesus Christ, I think I've died and... gone to... heaven. Well, Stan. Do you feel, uhb- better now? From the n-n-, from the nn-, from the nn- Wha, what, what's the m-matter, f-fellas? Are you ... nnnninjas or p-p-p-pussies? Bu bu bubu bu bu bubu Butters! Say fellas, JImmy and I were wondering if maybe you would come and cheer for us next Sssaturday. We're both competing in the Special Olympics down in Denver. Timmy and I are competing in a variety of events. Thanks a lot, fellas. Well, we gotta get down to the training center and start working out. Word is we have a lot of ssstiff competition this year. ...six!... Usss-usss-seven! Usss-usss-seven! Ni-I can'-I can't!  Huff. Oh man. Gee whiz, Timmy. It looks like we have some ppppretty stiff competition this year.  All of the special athletes seem to be in tip-top condition, and I can't even get past seven ru-reps. Huhh oh well, that's it for me, Timmy. I'm p-p--p-pooped. I'll see you in the locker room. You too, Francis. Oh hey hey, n-Nathan. Yeah, it sure is tough. I'm training really hard, but I'm not improving fast enough, and the Special Olympics are a... week away. What kind of shortcuts? S-s--ss-s-s-steroids?  ...But aren't those illegal? So uh, ha-how do they... w-wwork? How much would this cost me? Well... then maybe I'll just use them a-al-little bit. You know, as a per-formance en...hancer. Oh! Agh! Just, just a second! Hang on, I'm I'm, coming. I said I'm coming! Give me a Goddamned s-second!  Hold it. Nn-no, Dad. Oh. Hi, N-N-Nancy. Oh. Sure thing. Come on in. Yeah, Dad. We've been going out since we met in Free Period last week. Dad, Jesus C-Christ! You did a great job in the 500, Timmy. You really im-...p-p-proved. I think I really got a shot at the gold in the swimming competition. Coach says I'm the fastest he's ever seen. Well, I'll see you nice and early for p-practice, Tim-tim. Oh, uh, can you hand me my bag? Oh, uh, so... hey Timmy... uh hu-how about we go out for a d-d-ddoughnut later?  I'll uh, I-I'll see you later, Tim-Tim. Look it's really none of your b...b-b...beeswax, Timmy! Because I, maybe I don't have what it takes to win with uhwithout them! You you aren't gonna... tell anybody, are you? Look, it's my body and it's my choice what I put in it! Don't lecture me on the complexities of sportsmanship. You know as well as I do most of the kids in Special Olympics aren't shooting up to compete. I'm just trying to k-keep up. Sssso what are you gonna do now, huh?! You gonna be a fuckin' narc and show that bbottle to the ...coaches?!  Don't think you're any better than me, Timmy! I'm just living in the real world! Yyyeess! Grrrr! Yeah, I've been working out... r-r-really hard. Yeah, b-bigger, stronger! Come on, push it! Push it!  Yeah. Nice p-pecs. Sweet b-biceps. The Games are in two days, Nancy. I can't be w-wasting my time. Oh Jeez!  Are you gonna start running your mouth off again?  P-push it! Push it!! Theh-they're all just ..jealous. You're not leaving me! You try to leave me and I'll kill you, bitch! I said, shut your mouth, bitch! Why did you make me do it, huh?!  You're not leavin' anybody!! You just keep your G-Goddamned mouth shut and do what you're t-t-t-uh-tol-told! Stay away from me, you stupid bbbbitches! No! God! Top athlete, yeah! Yeeessss!  Yes! Yes! Yeah! Yeah!  Yeah, I did it!  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Fuck yeah!  Yeah, I did it! I'm the bbub-best! Hey! Just what the hell do you think you're doing, Eric?! You ffffaked being handicapped to win?! I should k-kick your ass right here, you lousy no-good ch-ch-ch...cheater! What? Oh my God. You, you're right, Timmy. You're totally right.  Everyone, can I have your attention, please?  I'm afraid I have to give back my medal. The truth is, I haven't been playing fair either. I've been using st-steroids. I was willing to do anything to be the best, and the steroids made me blind to the people I was hurting.  A good friend even tried to talk me out of it, and I wouldn't listen to him.  Taking steroids is just like pretending to be handicapped at the Special Olympics. Because you're taking all the fairness out of the game. But I know now that even if you do win on steroids, you're really not a winner. You're just a p-pussy. You're just a  big fat p-p...p...pussy, and if you take steroids, the only decent thing to do is come forward and say, ""Remove me from the record books, because I am a big, stinky p-pussy-""  ""-steroid-taking jackass.""  That's how I feel about myself, and why I must decline this medal and my place in the history books. And if That''s a... fantastic idea fellas. Uh, the key to successful humor is s- staying power. Uh tell me the first mascot idea. Heh, huh okay, that's pretty funny. Now, what's the second? Turhr... Ohokahay. Okay, now let's wait ten seconds.  Okay now, t-tell me the first one again? And the second? Gee, th-they're both screamingly funny, fellas. Uhhhbetter give it another ten seconds. All right, now we'll see which one really has staying power. Number one? Okay, I think, that's it. Number 2? Gee, I don't know what to say, fellas. They're both instant classics. But I guess I'll have to go with giant douche, simply because the fact that it's a giant renders it useless, adding a parody slant to the satire. Hello, Mrs. M-marsh. Can I help g... Can I help you get a sh- shopping cart today? Welcome to Ssuper School News. I'm Jimmy Valmer. The price of milk money will go up next Monday to 49 cents. The school claims the added money is due to the cow shortage in South Park County. More snow for South P... p-p Park. Here's Token Black with the weather. And that's all for Super School News.

This a b-b-bastardized quest for ratings! Damnit, we have a journalistic responsibliltiy to bring students the fa... the facts!  Don't you see what we've done? In our efforts to compete with Craig's small-minded show, we've made a mockery of n-nununews reporting. I remember when we all made an oath to each other, way back when started playing news reporter, that we would never let anything jeopardize our integrity! Well our integrity is jeopardized! And if we can't report news the honest way, what good is n-news reporting? Fellas! Don't you see? This proves my point. We have to elevate our ideas up, not down. Wow, coming up with ideas is... hard. B-b-bbingo! Wha, what do you think, fellas? I think maybe he's f-feeling it. Fellas, this is our chance! Everyone get your hair looking as fantastic as possible. It's time for us to do the most incredible investigative news report of our journalistic lives!

She's very excited to get started on her new show, ""Martha Stewart Living, with an electronic ankle bracelet.""  So it looks like the Vatican has finally chosen a new Pope. Have you seen this, have you heard about this?  A-a-apparently they're going to call him New Pope, a-and refer to John Paul as P-Pope Classic.  Uh,.. so it so it looks like Michael Jackson is having back problem in court.  You know... huh... you uh you know what they say about b-b-b-b-back problems. Uh, uh gee, what a terrific audience. What a fantastic audience. Nuh uh! Wuh. Huh. Waaagh! Ungh! Butters! Butters, ah I really need to talk to somebody, and I think maybe you're the only person who won't make f-f-fun of me. Butters, do you know what you're supposed to do when your penis gets hard? Really?? So, when your penis becomes hard, you're supposed to put in in a lady's vagina. And then it stops being hard? But where am I going to find a lady to stick my penis in? The talent show is this Friday. Hey Bertha. Well Bertha, I was wondering if I could stick my penis in your vagina? But the talent show is tomorrow!  Ooo! I'm trying to get laid. What's it look like? Wow, seems like you know a lot about this stuff, Eric. Have you gotten laid before? Well, wha-what do I do?

We're going to an authentic Italian restaurant, Buca de Fagghecini Uh, I think we're gonna try your authentic pizzareli casserona poppers Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.

I'm... not gonna perform in the talent show. I just c-can't risk getting up in front of everyone. All right! I I keep getting an erection for no reason! Okay! But I can't get any of the girls here to let me... do it to them. Then why does God make it so that my penis gets hard if girls don't wanna have it in their vaginas? It's like a cruel joke. ...Colfax Point? Really? M-maybe I can catch the bus ...and get down there before the talent show ends. Th-thanks, Officer Barbrady! Hello? Hello?

Stay on him! I'm not giving up! Get close to him!  How much do I owe you? C-can I just get two back, please? Thank you. Don't worry, Nut Gobbler! I'm coming! Oh Jesus, not now.  Oh boy, this is embarassing. Hey, j-j-jackass!  I'm sorry I resorted to calling you jackass just now, but I'm very upset! What do I have? The weapon of comedy. So apparently the Chinese and the Japanese aren't getting along lately. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? I'll tell you one thing: their food hasn't been getting along with my stomach for years. Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? She's apparently gotten real good with baking cakes with keys in them. Nice teamwork, Nut Gobbler. Not really. You're just a hooker, and I need to get laid. The talent show could be over any minute. Hold everything!  Mrs. Garrison, if you don't mind, I'll be taking that microphone.."
"A BADGER","Hello, kidsh, I'm Happy, the ""Don't Do Stuff That Might Irritate Your Inner Ear"" Badger.  Well, I'll leave now."

The name of the band is Timmy AND the Lords of the Underworld, not just Timmy. And the Lords of the Underworld! It's always about you, isn't it?! I'm sick of it! Timmy gets all the applause! Timmy gets all the chicks! Well, you know what?! Forget you, man! Shut up, Monsy! You can stay and deal with Mr. Egomaniac here, but I'm novin' on!  I don't need Timmy!  I'm goin' solo! No! Don't try and stop me, man!  I'll see you on fame's backside. Hey dudes. They booed Phil Collins off the stage. Everyone's chanting for Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld. I don't expect anything. Timmy, I-gh... Well, I just wanted to say we had some pretty rockin' times, dude, and... maybe I let fame and Phil Collins go to my head... What do you say, Timmy?"
"A CAT","Meow.  Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow."
"MARK","Oh, really?! Dude, this is gay! You shut up! Your girlfriend is not joining our band! ""Conscientious."" May I have the definition, please? ""Conscientious."" Could you use it in a sentence, please? ""Conscientious."" C O N S C I E N T I O U S. It was nice competing against you boys. We will have to do it again sometime. No. I live right over there.  I've lived there all my life. Because I'm home-schooled. My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school. Right. Oh my goodness, are you two enemies? Strange, friends would call each other names and fight. Papa? Why can't I go to school with the other boys? But I want to play with the other children. O, how they laugh and play, Papü¾¼. I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like. Please, Papü¾¼. Just let me try it for a few days. Hooray! Hey, guys. What's up? The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade. I don't understand. You seem to like that boy, yet hate him at the same time. Oh. I promised my father I wouldn't. You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose? Oh, dear. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Well, they duct-taped me to a bench. I don't know, mother. It didn't make any sense at all. But I want to go back tomorrow, papü¾¼. Please, just give me one more day. Can I sit here with you? Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend? I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place. Ah! Stick and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me. Huh? Oh, papü¾¼. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow? Alright. She's upstairs playing Doctor with that Kyle boy. Rebecca, what the devil are you doing? You're out of control.  You did this to my sister! You made my sister into a slut! I'll kill you! You dip! I'm gonna whip your bitch ass! ...I'm not through with you, bitch! Calm down, papü¾¼!  Everything is all right.  You see, I've learned something today. Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on.  Don't you see, papü¾¼? That's what happened to your daughter. You tried so hard to keep her from anythng sexual, and now look at her. She's a God-damned whore, papü¾¼. I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things. Thanks, gaywad. See ya, papü¾¼! Hey, you guys, you'd better stop fighting. Who is that? Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous. Yeah. Oh, so now that they want us, you think you can waltz, um, back into our lives and be in the band again? Hn they want us back. Wow. That is about the nicest Trapper Keeper I've ever seen. Well that does it! I'm gonna have to report this!  Cargo on to base-  AAGH! Relax, Linda, everything's fine.  Ow. Ow. No, ud, it's lemon juice. No, it just really, really, really hurts! Don't be scared. They're just kids. Where are your parents?! ...Okay, I'm scared now, too. That freaked me out. Get off me! What the hell is gong on here?! Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult this instant! The mayor! Good! Finally! No parents in the entire town? What happened to them? No phones, either? How do you communicate? Alright, we've had just about enough here! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! I don't care what little games you kids wanna play, we just want outta here, alright? I have the job interview of my life in Breckenridge! Just tell me how to get to a phone or a car! Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care! Well, I told you I can't deal with kids, Linda! That's why I don't want to have children! Oh, let's not go through this again, Linda. D-  Look, here's the book they've been talking about-  it makes no sense. It's a boy.  They... killed him. Oh no! Uh. The fat kid told us to take it. Wuh. Aah! Mark! Mark, wake up! Why are you doing this? Who? Look, I have the job interview of my life in less than-  -12 hours! I just need a phone, and he said he'd help me if I took your book so you couldn't... kill them anymore. I'll do anything to get to a phone! Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is? No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on.  Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone. I know, but this will all be over soon. Alright, I got the book for you. Now, can I please have the cell phone? Give him the book back. Enough of this! You kids are all in big trouble! Stop right there! Nobody's killing anybody tonight! What? Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents! The birth-givers! Your birthgivers. Don't you remember? They are your providers! Not some statue! And they're not up in some fantastical faraway land now. They're in prison. Probably crying themselves to sleep, cold and lonely and... I'm sure missing you all very, very much.  Your birthgivers took care of you. That's what their laws and their rules were for, because they love you, and they didn't want you to end up living like... th-this!  He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will. If you want things to be the way they were in the before time, in the long, long ago, you all need to call the police and tell them you lied about them M word. Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left?? Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we should have some. Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge. But... they're... children! I just think that all this sex ed and condom talk in elementary school is wrong! I don't think we have any that'll even fit them! Hi! All right! Let's play! All right! Go Dave! Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your songs? That's a great story, Sarah. All right! Woohoo! OOWW! Only the most important person in the world. I'm a lion. We'd miss you too, Gary. Heh. Let's go.  Our faces are painted. Wow, what a great house! Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith."
"JONESY","Oh, I'd like to see you do any better, bitch! Yeah, dude. What the hell is wrong with you, anyway? She's like, 12. Dude, we never win the Battle of the Bands! It's no big deal. Dude, we've been practicing for eight years, Skyler. What was that? Dude, that's hot! We did it, dude! Alright, let's rock this house! Hello Miami! Another great show, man. There must have been a hundred thousand people out there. What's the matter, Skyler? Man, it sucks not being part of Lalapalabala. Skyler, what are you doing here?!  Isn't Reach for the Skyler supposed to play soon? Wow. They really are chanting for us."
"ORAGNE CAT","Rowr! Geuugh."
"BUTTERS","Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room.  Uh, this here is Dougie.

Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be. Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels. No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it. Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid? Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley. Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it. Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels! Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown. Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for? So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder? Well, hooray! Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea.  Uh I got to thinkin', ""Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?"" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was. Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission? Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we? Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such? Uh let me handle this, Stan.  Uh now l-listen up and listne good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves!

Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this. Yeah, he ah knew you'd say that, too, so he said t'say, ah, up your ass, Jew. Yeah. Oh, it's all sticky. Uhyeah? Eh just about. Oh. Well, uhokay. Right.  Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls. Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya. It's a-  Awww, shucks,  I can't tell you. Uh but it's really nifty. Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it?? Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm goona get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs! Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long! That's me. That's me. Thaat's that's me,  Yeah. . Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz. Don't be silly, Mom. Of course he means you. Yes sir! We won't know until we're at Bennigan's. Dad's a good shopper all right. You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'? Sure I do! Inspector Butters in on the case, ma'am! Uh, that's me! Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice. ""White Swallow Bath House"" Uh, that's me! I'm back, Ma! I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night out. Well first, he went to see a movie. I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat. I didn't know it was open. ""Fisting Firemen 9""  I've never seen 1 through 8. Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him. To the gym. Yeah. The White Swallow Spa. Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for firteen minutes straight! Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for yoru present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'.  Oh, did you have a nice ""trip,"" Mom? See you next ""fall."" Hahaha, yo- Ma? Uh, that's me! Hm. Uh-I can't think of one. Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom? Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him. That's me! One please. Uh thanks! Dad?  Dad, you in here? Hello? Eh-anybody in here? Uh Mr. Garrison? Da-ad? Da-ad??  Are you wrestlin' in here?  Dad? Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  ndad? No. Hm. Hi Dad! I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your weiner out there, Dad? Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home. That's me! Uh, hey Dad. Well, sure thing, Dad. Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so. Little white lies? ...Uh, who's Jack? Oh no, that won't happen, Dad. Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine. A drive? Oh, boy!  I I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too? Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad.  Oh boy, a drive! Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along. Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too. Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' ""nutsack"" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself. Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere? It's cold out here. Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then. Well, I think I- Yeup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water!  Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom! That's me! Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now.  Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop,it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt. Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I goota get back home. Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I? That's me! That's me! And so them my friend started hollerin' at me, sayin' ""you took my rubber bands."" Well, I didn't take 'em, Craig, did. I saw Craig take 'em. Anyway, boy, I sure am lucky you came along, Mister. Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang myself right now. Have you ever been to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow night with my family. Oh, I can just see it now.  We'll walk in the front doors,  and the nice Bennigan's hostess lady will take us to our cozy booth Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks, for appetizers.  Dad will open his present, and Mom will open hers  Uh then the Bennigan's wait staff will sing Oh. Hello? Uh, who is this? Uh, is this the Stotch residence? ...No. ...No. That's me! Sir? Hello? Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar. I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow. Uh will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road? ...Well, it's my parents' anniversay tomorrow,  and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em. Oh jeez. For family fun and great food, too, come on down to... Bennigan's ...Bennigan's. That's me! Happy Anniversary! Oh.  Alright, then. I- Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was- I ain't grounded, am I? Lie? Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary. Uh stop it, Mom and Dad. Now gosh darn it, you!  You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble!  Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here with you two! Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I? ...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's? Yeah! Yeah! Ye-!  wait, what? Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ! Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now. I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup.

I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow! Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos! Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins. I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uhwill bow down to me! Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos! Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!  And that's only the beginning! It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot Bennigan's. Yeh, you didn't? Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick? Nothing.  Nothing!  It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deads covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to take it up a notch! Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?! Ms. Choksondik, Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad. Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be. The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools! I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand! Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there. Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail. It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  There we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos. Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon.  Aaahhh! A note? Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions!  We haven't much time! Oh, hey Dougie.  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos. Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down! Aw minions, naw, not that way. He- come back minions. Join me? But why? Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red. Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray. Now let us go look for my minions! They ran away here, now to find 'em... People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos, and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... flood... the world! Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch! Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle! Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure is takin' a long time. Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete. Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer. Hey, who is that? Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back! Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but-  but now they have left me with no other choice! This is is, General Disarray. My final solution. Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the Hey, fellas. How are things... oing with your new best friend? Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters. Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up here, uh doin' my homework.  Yes. By day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT...  nobody knows that he actually has a dark underside... Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak havoc on the world that shunned me! Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray. Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity. Simple, my dear general.  We are going to block out the sun! Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide , precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow. Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be! Huh? He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original. Aww, I don't wanna do it now , not if they already did it on the Simpsons. I have to think of something else. Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it? General Disarray, are your parents home? Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date. You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa, yeah! Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news! Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc! I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos! Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch. Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that? Stupid Simpsons... Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money.  No? Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their- I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen- Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the- Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that- Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! Dwaah!! I've done it, General Disarray. I've watches all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold! This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise.  People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey! You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right? Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us! Nnno , uh no, no, it can't be. No! No! Aaaaah! Oh sweet Jesus! Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo! Waaaah!  Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! Haaah! Aaah! Nooo! Haaa! Cartman? Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha! They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha! Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter. Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again. I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again! Compassionate. You mean, like a goldfish? Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh? Wuuhh, it's really fun.You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me. Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen. Uh here comes an SUV. Me too! Stupider than Bebe! Huh Bebe's cool, huh. Huh, fellas? Yeah! Uhyep. Then we gotta work on your campaign. Huh, I'm over here, Dad. Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it! Ah I won't get scared, Mom.

I promise. So how is your day going? Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD. Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times. Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money Uh-okay.

Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again. Uh but I spent it all. On my girlfriend. Yeah. Yup! Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  But don't embarass me or nothin'.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you. Okay. Here we are, Mom and Dad! Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her. Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus! Mom? Dad? This is Lexus. Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus. Huh? Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my girlfriend!

And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint! ... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore? So that's it? We're broken up now? Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over. Oh  Uh hey, hey Stan. Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me. Yeah.  It sure does hurt. Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life. Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like, ih ih, ih it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid... Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan.

Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff. Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days. Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me. No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again! Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets! When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! Hi sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake. Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it! I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout! Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll lhave my revenge, boy howdy! Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey!

All right, I'll help you! Mrs. Cartman? This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something. He says, he love you. He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes. He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted. Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times. He can't! Don't you understand?! God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him! Uhh all right then. Aww, that's okay, Eric. So I won't see you again? Wow. Yeh you're still here. Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough. Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did. Did you ever do anything really bad? Broke fence... Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for. Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this. Does this mean... you have to go now? Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason. Eric! Calm down.  Stupid butthole God! Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost! Lu lu lu, lu lu lu So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time. Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you. Ahhh. AAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore. Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event. Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain! Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you? Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane. Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time! Really? Well, he's sittin' next to me right now. Hey, I think she could see you too. You really are a ghost. Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me. Eric.  Well, be careful, ghost pal. Hurry. Go, go! Boy, we sure did. Yeah. Uh I feel that way too. I'll miss you too, ghost pal. Huh? Hehey Jimmy!  M'boy, did you see that first prize for the talent show? Why you must be excited! You'll probably win like always. Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?! Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples, Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too. Lu Lu Lu, let's get together, I know what we can do, Lu Lu. Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy.  I'm just practicin' for the talent show. Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody with a problem. Well sure I do. Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her ""vagiiina."" Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk.thepenis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady. That's right, Jimmy. Lu lu lu, I'vw got some... some... uh, some uh... some, uh... uuuhhh... Oh no!  No no noho noo!"
"DOUGIE","I like math. What are you? A sourpuss? Neato. How should I know? Which Angel am I again? Air shaft. I wanna be a reporter someday. Do you think someday I can be a reporter? See how reporters get to wear those cool jackets? That's why I wanna be a reporter. This is Jill Munroe reporting live from inside the meteor shower party.  As youu can see, this is a perfectly normal party. Nobody is killing themselves. We tried to tell ATF people, but they shot at us.  Anything else? Oh yeah. Don't burn us, please. Jill Munroe, GFN news. Hey, I'm a real reporter. Wow, you mean that? I didn't even get a chance to have them get to know me! Hey Butters. I saw you change in the school bathroom. You stole that eraser in your class. I'm, not trying to call you out, Professor Chaos. I want to join you. Yeah I want to join you in your conquest of destruction. I'm an outcast, too. A frail child cast aside by society. I want to follow you and... whatever you're doing. Do I get a neato costume made out of aluminum foil, too? General Disarray. It's on all the way. Hey, do you think maybe we should build a boat? You know, like a little raft or something, so that when the world floods you and me and the minions can live? What do we do now? What evil plot do you have this time, Professor Chaos? Professor Chaos! I have done as you asked and brought the first load of scrap wood. What dastardly deed are we doing now? Oh. Oh, awesome! Cool. It'll be just like on the Simpsons. They did that on the Simpsons. I think it was the Mr. Burns character. He tried to block Springfield from the sun. So how do we build it? No. What? Oh, uh... You seemed so proud, I didn't wanna bum you out. ...Simpsons did it. The did it in episode 204. Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! Episode 9F17 entitled ""So It's Come To This!"" ...Simpsons did it. No, I think the Simpsons would be more clever than that. Uh oh, Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! Don't have a cow, man. Simpsons did it!! Simpsons did it!!"
"ALL THREE","Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. Five million dollars???"
"ATF LEAD","This must be the place. They've got all kinds of crazy stuff going on in there. Get down! It's just like we told you, officer! There's a religious cult in there that plans to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts. Of course we're sure!  We're the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms! It's our job to know what these fanatics do! Oh, don't worry! We won't let that happen! Even if it means we have to kill each and every one of them. What's the situation? Any luck talking to somebody in the house? Alright. Johnson! I'm sending you in. Watch your ass. Damnit, where is Johnson?! Those bastards! Hold it right there! Whatever it is you are intending to do, do not do it! Your freaky religious cult will not succeed in its plan! Do not move, or we will be forced to shoot-  God damnit, who was that?! Did you see them move?! Lay down your weapons! Go back inside and tell everyone that they are surrounded! Tell them to come out peacefully, and we will not shoot them. I don't think they're gonna come out. Use the Ganz technique. This is what we did in Waco.  Play really bad music really loud until it drives them nuts and makes them want to come out.  Nobody can stand this much Cher. This is her new album. If this doesn't drive them out, nothing will."
"ATF AGENT","Code 7. We believe we have found the compound. Request immediate backup. Apparently, we've got at least five dozen men and women in there who intend to commit suicide when the meteor shower starts. We've tried calling, but there's no answer. I think we're gonna have to move in, sir. No communication, sir. It doesn't look good for him. Sir, this isn't gonna look good."
"BURLY MAN","Eh that's true, but Elway was the heart of the team. Who's the leader now? Well... Let's go kick his ass! Aw!"
"OTHER MEN","Yeah! Geraaald! Hi Gerald. Oh no, errrr! They took your jobs! They took yer jobs!!"
"BARBARDY","What's the Ganz techique? What kind of shit is this?"
"GOATEED MAN","Yeah, well, you know what I heard? I I heard that he's gay. Huh? Ricky Martin, the singer."
"OTHER MAN","Oh, is he?"
"GANZ","We have not had any cooperation with the cult inside the house. They are refusing to come out, and apparently they still plan to commit mass suicide once the meteor shower starts, which should be any moment now. Right now, our plan is to burn the house down. If we set it on fire, they'll have no choice but to come out. It is, but we can't let them kill themselves. Attention, cult people! Do not commit mass suicide! There are so many reasons not to kill yourselves! Flowers, for instance. And backrobs.  Alright, I'm through trying to reason with them. Send in the Negotiator! We know what we're doing. We did this all before in Waco. Look. You see this? You see this? You see it? You see it? Go get it. Go get it!  Alright, let's get ready to kick some religious fanatic ass! Look out!  Ho-old your fire! Okay, hrm. People at the door! That was a warning! Go back inside and tell the others that they now have one minute to surrender! Alright, people, prepare to fire on my command! Alright everyone, fire! Uh oh.  Uh uh attention everyone! This has only been a test. Good job, men, on this, uh, simulation. Sh.  All is well. Do not shoot at Woops. You're right. Quick, let's get out of here!"
"MAN IN BRIEFS","Aw, I was just in the hot tub."
"BLOND AGENT","Simulation? Aw, crap! We got the wrong NAMBLA. Wow. You guys really do look a lot like Marlon Brando."
"DEREK","Say, that was a fine piece of journalism, boys. Sure. Why, with your tape, I'll be able to make millions and further my career beyond my wildest dreams."
"RANGER","Welcome to Jewbilee. You folks find it okay? Yeah. We spotted him a few days ago. Nothing to worry about, though. Your boys are safe with us. Name? What? Alright, get to Meshuggeneh Hall! The meeting is already starting."
"SQUIRT LEADER","Come on, Squirt! We're meeting over here! I'm the Squirt leader. I don't want to be the Squirt leader, but I don't have a choice; it's the only way I can earn my chutzpah badge. So I gotta spend all night instructing Squirts. Come on! Okay, Squirts, the elders have given us a very important task tonight. We are all going to make macaroni pictures, like this one,  using dry macaroni, paper, and glue. Because that's what Squirts do! Now, shut your pie-hole! Okay, Squirts, let's see what you made macaroni pictures of. Ishmael? Good. Matthew? Joseph? Okay. Ike? ...You don't make a macaroni picture of the Last Supper at a Jewish camp! What the Jeez?  Oh my God, it's that bear they've been talking about!  Where did it go?! Squirts, go grab your gear! We're gonna hunt us a bear! Then I'll get my Chutzpah badge for sure! We are Squirts, we are Squirts. We're so kosher that it hurts. Oh, no!  Oh, God!  Oh, the bear took a Squirt. Oh, I'm gonna get it now! Now, we'll just see how Mr. Bear likes rat poison.  Well now, that'll be enough to kill a stupid bear. Okay, raise the tray!  Chutzpah badge, here I come. Yikes!  Okay, here he comes. Easy now. Easy, Squirts.  Okay, Squirt, lower the tray.  That's it. That's it, you God-damned stupid bearface! Jesus! Hell, he got another Squirt! You think you can stop me from getting my Chutzpah badge, you stupid bear?! Think again! We are Jew Squirts, we know Jewish Remember, this is only a bear. All we have to do is stick together, and we can spend the rest of the night making bear sandwiches!  Where's Zigmo? God-damnit! You stupid God-damned son of a bear, you've taken your last Squirt! Do you hear me?! That bear thinks he can outsmart me! Well, I'm not gonna let a stupid bear get the-  Hold! Look over there!  It's one of the Squirts the bear took. Maybe he's okay.  IT'S A TRAP!!  Damn! Damn damn damn! Okay, bear, that does it! You wanna kill all the Squirts?! You can have 'em! I give up! I don't need my Chutzpah badge, or Jew Scouts, or any of this crap! Forget it! Elder Schwartz, I lost the Squirts! I lost all the Squirts!  Well, screw you too! I don't need your Chutzpah badge anyway! Hello?"
"CHIEF ELDER","Baleilah hazein, Hame kadesh mekoh hikenazu puanazikeh hakeilah. (Now gather us, the elders, on this most holy of nights.) I want to welcome you all. Though we each come from a different sect of Judaism, on this night of Jewbilee, we all pray to Moses as one. Hineinih kureh leirukeshu. (May all the power of Moses show the way) Now, let us all introduce ourselves. I don't believe I've heard of the Anti-Semitic sect of Judaism before. Elehem hav dorim, ashoseveh laoleinu. Hakadosh boruku, omasheh hachreit. (Tonight, for the meteor shower, we will pray to Moses. Then we will give Moses thanks.) All sects of Judaism follow the words of Moses. Enough, elder! You will not speak the name of Haman here! We accept all denominations of Judaism here at Scouts, elder, but your synagogue of anti-Semites is too strange! Get out and do not return: you are no longer welcome here! Hello! Alright, Jew Scouts, the meteor shower will start soon. Let's pray to Moses for guidance.  Moses, great leader, on this blessed night of Jewbilee, we ask for your tutelage. Great Moses, we, your most loyal followers, want to thank you a lot for coming. Alright Scouts, let's all show Moses our soap sculptures so that he may rejoice and be pleased. Moses, the Squirts have made you tidings of macaroni pictures. They should be here any second.  Where the hell are the Squirts?  We need those macaroni pictures for Moses right now! Great and honorable Moses, what do you desire from us, your children? Yeh yes, yes, the macaroni pictures are coming right away. Uh, anything else you want from us, O great leader of the people? You heard him. Get to making popcorn necklaces right away!  All you need is some popcorn, and a needle and thread. An impurity, Moses? Scout Broflovski, have you defiled Jew Scouts by bringing a non-Hebrew to Jewbilee?! A non-Jew has inflitrated Jew Scouts and looked upon the face of Moses! He must be dealt with! You are banished from here. You must leave before the great eating of carrot cake. Go now. You do not belong here. :	Elder, what are you doing?! Elder, what have you done? Elder, you cannot mean-. If he summons Haman, we will all be destroyed. If he summons Haman, it will be the end of everything we hold dear. No! It's hopeless."
"ELDRES","Helalelah, het Moshe. (Praise Moses.)"
"ELDER GARTH","We're new. Oh, enough already? What has Moses ever done for us? Not mine. Tonight's meteor shower is a sign of the New Time, heh. We should use it to pray to Haman and enter into a new millennium faith, and ih- All you ever do is worship Moses, but it says in the Book of Centuries that Haman will one day lead the Jews. If you guys love Moses so much, why don't you marry him?! Fine!  Jewbilee is the time of Haman! You will all see how wrong you are, very soon! When Haman returns from the Ninth Tower of Disillusionment, and smotes Moses and all his followers into pillars of dust that would cry for their petty lives but can't, having recently been turned into dust and all, you will see! You will see thie very night! Stupid assholes. Moses ain't gonna teach them anything!  Do not fear, Haman. This night shall be yours, and the anti-Semitic Jews will once again rule the Earth. And it was foretold that the spirit of Moses would finally rest when his spirit was imprisoned by Haman in a conch shell of blind faith. Conch shell, like this one, hnee. Infatu camdavid. David hakum ba'ikan shtud! Shtud balaa shtud inca inca brusht! Enter the conch shell, Moses! And there you shall stay, trapped for all eternity! I told you, the meteor shower is the time of Haman! I am running Jewbilee now! I don't think so! Now. All of you into that building, or I shoot you where you stand! Move! And the Ancient One looked upon Haman as the new leader of the people!  And it was the night that stars flew around the sky!  Yes! Yess!! Let the New Tide turn! Let Haman rule his people once again! We await your return, Haman!  Your passage is safe from the enemies! Don't move! It's the summoning of Haman, fool! The awakening of a new kingdom, heeheh! Moses is trapped for all eternity in the conch of blind faith! Enough of this waste of time!  Haman! The Great Summoning is done! Upon these words let your spirit come! Einich! Hos! Zayak. Kareem! Hey, give that back! Give me that book! Haman will deal with you! Ramek shtud! Yes! Yes! Haman! It's me, Garth! I freed you! Nooo! Eheh. Nooo!  Moses. Uh I, I apologize for any inconvenience, eheh. Uh yuh you see, I was just uh- No! Aaaaaah! Ooww!"
"ELDER","And that's how we'll be making tonight's craft. And so you see, Scouts, all you need is a bar of soap and a dull knife , and you can make nifty soap sculptures like these. Here's a giraffe.  And here's a cloud.  You can all pick up your bars of soap later on, as we will all be making soap sculptures tonight.  Now, this year we are pleased to announce that Jewbilee has grown to over one hundred Jew Scouts from all around the country. All new inductees, raise your hands. Uuuuhh, yess, and what is your name, young man? O-oh, wonderful, uh, uh, um.  Cuh, Could you run out and grab some- some of those candles for us?  There we go. Ahem. Now, I would like all the new inductees to step forward, please. Raise your left hand and repeat after me: I pleadge to be a Jew Scout. My honor, wide and true. I am proud to be a Jew Scout. Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew. Lahit chaim. Lahit chaim. Lahit chaim. Release Moses, now! Haman will be summoned and we will be forced to obey him, or die. Yeah, obeying should work out swell."
"INDUCTEE","Junichi."
"INDUCTEES","I pledge to be a Jew Scout. My honor, wide and true. I am proud to be a Jew Scout. Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew."
"ISHMAEL","Apple."
"MATTHEW","Cat. Oh, funt.  No!"
"JOSEPH","Triangle."
"ELDER HARRIS","We pray to Moses here, elder. He's reading from the Book of Haman! Uh I'm fine with obeying. They'll never reach. Oh, no. It's too late! That blow to his head must have killed him. We've learned a lot from you and your great friend, Kenny. Yes."
"THE SCOUTS","May the teachings of Moses fill our ears and our hearts respectively."
"O."," O.  O."
"MOSES","The hour of Jewbilee is near. Let all debts be forgiven and all slaves freed. Mwaaaaaaaaaah! I desire...  I desire... mamaroni pictures. I desire... popcorn necklaces. Hold!  There is... an impurity. This child here is not kosher. No cake for the impurity! Aaaaaaaah! Eo! Eh! Diu! Die! Every year we shall gather here in this special place and bring Kenny tidings of soap sculptures and macaroni pictures. Give me the information. His magic is a combination of centrifugal line and sleight of hand. Wait a minute: I'm picking up movement from Blainetologists from all over the country. What? ...Um... Let me think, um... a giant stone John Wilkes Booth?"
"SQUIRT","Aaah!  Ah!  AAAAH! Ah! Aaaah! Hey, welcome to the party.  See this li'l bear cub? It's his birthday. They are? Uh oh. Come on, Squirts. We have to help them. Squirts, fall in. Chinese formation."
"GARTH","Oh no, he's on to me, Haman."
"SCOUT","When do we get to eat carrot cake? I wanna go home. Kid, how would you like your own talking to the dead show?"
"BEAR CUB","Mrar."
"SHLOMO","What the Jeez?  What are you guys doing in there? Sorry, suckers! This is an R-rated movie. But, because this is such an important film that actually depicts the selfless act of Jesus Christ, I'll let you in to see it. Pretty brutal, isn't it? Kinda wanna make you change your life, huh? Huh? I can't refund your money. You sat through the whole movie. That guy happened to be Jesus, and he went through all that to pay for YOUR SINS! I'm now allowed to give you your money back after you sat through the whole movie! You'd have to take your complaint up with the film's producers. Yeah. I'd like to see you try. Yeah, so I see this ad on the Internet saying if you love The Passion to come to this meeting, so here I am! We sure do! What a great idea! Ooo, Aramaic. Cool. Can I help you? Remove it from the theater? Fat chance! They're trying to have The Passion pulled from the theater. That's... Mel Gibson?"
"SCHLOMO","What?! I lost the Squirts! Huh? Oh, Jiminy gravy, what is this?? You can't wake Haman. What would Moses say? Oh, no you don't!  OOWW!!"
"ELDER SCHWARTZ","Get the keys and unlock the door! Look out! It is lost. It's the Squirts. Unlock the door, Squirts! The keys are up there. It is Haman."
"HAMAN","Free! Free to punish those that imprisoned me! Moses! Nooo!"
"ELDER CARN","He saved us. He saved all the Jews."
"DJ","We're here live at the KOZY 102.1 Hallween Haunt at the South Park docks! Come on down! We've got a haunted house and everyone is decorating for tomorrow night,  HALLOWEEN, when the band KoRn, that's right, KoRn, is going to play live! And don't forget to wear a costume tomorrow, because there's a big first prize! Why, here's some kids enjoying the Halloween Haunt now!  Say boys, what do you think of KOZY-FM's Halloween Haunt so far? Uh-hall right! Well, enjoy the spooky docks, kids. Joining me now is Father Maxi, from the South Park Church. Father, what do you think of all the preparations here at the docks? Yeah, and how about KoRn playing the big concert tomorrow? Pretty exciting, huh? Alriight, we'll see you tomorrow for Halloween! In the meantime  here's a KOZY hit by Barry Manilow. It's Halloween day, so come on down to the docks and bring your costumes! Aah, guys, I'm sorry, but the Halloween Haunt's been cancelled. You best clear out of here! There's pirate ghosts, and they'll kill you. Well all right, guests, put your hands together. Be sure to tip the dancers. And now, come on, let's here it for Candy! Huh alright guys, put your hands together, a lot of shootin' and killin' goin' on, but be sure to tip your waitress let's hear it for Rebecca. -the Beatles in the White Album in Helter Skelter. Okay."
"GUESTS IN LINE","Awwww!"
"DR. SPOOKALOT","Here I have a bowl of human eyeballs. And here you can feel the brains. And here you can feel the warm innards of the body"
"BOY IN GREEN SHIRT","BOO! Ha ha ha ha ha! We scared you, chickens! Oh no? Well, you should be!  The pirate ghosts are gonna come getcha! Didn't you know? There's an old legend in South Park that says these docks are haunted by pirate ghosts. Yuh-huh. They roam these docks with their swords and hook-hands  looking for victims tuh...  cut up! Ha ha ha ha, gotcha again, heh ha ha! Just wait till tomorrow! We're gonna scare you kids to death! Ha ha ha haa!"
"PIRATE GHOST CUTOUT","Rar!"
"FR. MAXI","Halloween is an abomination of God! A celebration of the occult-eh! KoRn is a devil-worshipping group that plays violent music! If we allow that demon band to play on this most unholy of holidays, we may incur the full wrath of evil! I know who you are and what you stand for! I think your music and Halloweenn is an abomination! I warned you! I told you this would happen!  When you allow bands like KoRn to come to town and play your hedonistic Hallowen concerts, this is what you get! Whoa! Well, what are you waiting for, Barbrady?! Arrest that band! Because Halloween is an abomination of God. I would do anything to stop this wretched, unholy holiday! No. I tell you, Mayor, these Japanese are trying to change our American children somehow! We're sorry we took your time, gentlemen. Nice guys. We want to see God!  FR. MAXI God? God is going to show himself?? And so it was that God sent his only son down from heaven, to die for our sins. ...What is troubling you, my child? Ah! You mean he's a Jew! Yes, The Passion is very powerful. The truth is, there's not a whole lot in the Bible about the Crucifixion. The Passion was actually done as a performance piece back in the Middle Ages to incite people against the Jews. Well, if you really care about your friend's soul, then perhaps show him the way of Jesus. Remember: Christianity is about... atonement."
"PIRATE GHOSTS","Darrrr! Aarrrrgh. Aarrrrgh!"
"JONATHAN","Are you sure we're goin' the right way? Don't think about it. We'll just keep playing our game. Raady? I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter T! You've got it. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter R. That's it! Okay, here's one. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter P. Puh-pirate ghosts! Oh, fwooh, I was really scared there, for a second. Yeah. I'm Jonathan , and this is Munky , David , Fieldy , and Head . And over there is our pal, Nibblet.  Hey, where'd Nibblet go? Oh, swell. We're supposed to play here tomorrow. Do you know where the stage is? Oh, hi. We're KoRn. We're supposed to play the Halloween concert tomorrow. Groovy! Could you show us where to set up? Great rehearsal, gang. That was really groovy. Let's practice one more time before the show starts. Cancelled? Well gang, it looks like we have to pack it up. Say, what's the matter? You kids look kind of glum. Well, that does it. Somethin' funny is going on here. Your missing grandma must be connected somehow to those creepy pirate ghosts. Huh? But that makes them pirate ghosts. Pirate ghosts. Sure, we'll help you. If there's one thing we like more than playing music, it's solvin' a groovy mystery. So this is where you last saw your dead grandma. Alright, gang, we have to split up and look for clues. I know. Let's have everyone who enjoys having obstacles in their life, which they can overcome, go this way,  and everyone whose insecurities sabotage their potential to overcome those obstacles go that way. Say, this looks like a clue.  ""Pirate Lore of South Park."" Hmmm. Now, why would pirate ghosts need a book on pirates? The noise came from in here. Stay close, everybody! Fieldy, what are you doing?! Hey, there's Antonio Banderas! He'll help us.  Mr. Banderas! Alright, gang. Looks like we're gonna have to use our special KoRn powers. KoRn powers, vitalize! Jonathan! Alright! Great job, gang! Yeah. And now let's see who these pirate ghosts really are!  Oh, I guess they really were pirate ghosts. No! Arrest him! I think I've got this groovy mystery solved! It's simple. Priest Maxi didn't want there to be a Halloween, so he decided to scare everyone away from the docks. And all he had to do then was create a ghost ship, by using some candles, a mirror, and two squirrels. Well, sure. Why the heck not? Well, this sure has been a wacky night, but me and the gang learned a lot, and we hope you did too. You all perceived us to be mean, evil people, but, really, we're just normal guys. And we all perceived pirate ghosts to be real when, actually, they were just cotton swabs. So I guess the lesson is: it's easy to perceive somethin' someway, and then be wrong. So we all need to learn to be a little less perceptive. The gang and I wrote a song about it, and it goes goes a little somethin' like this:"
"DAVID","I don't know. This map doesn't make any sense. Oops. A road? Hey, Kenny. They're not pirate ghosts, Jonathan, they're ghost pirates. ""Pirate ghost"" would suggest that a pirate died, and became a ghost, but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later made a conscious decision to be a pirate. No. It makes them ghost pirates. Hey, I got an idea.  We should set a groovy trap. We need something that might catch their eye to use as bait. I know, your Antonio Banderas love doll. Okay. Here's how the trap will work. When the pirate ghosts walk in, they should go right for Antonio Banderas. When they hit the super-slippery floor, they'll slide onto this mining cart, which should travel down this path, into the next room, where the fish net will fall on them. Jonathan, no! Hold on, guys! David! You did it, Nibblet! You trapped them! Yeah. And then he used this flashlight and some cotton swabs to create the ghosts."
"HEAD","That's because you've got it upside down, chowderhead! The letter P? Wow! Is that the Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll? Guys! Guys! Guys! Fighting isn't gonna solve anything. Don't you see? This is exactly what those ghost pirates want us to do. What does this dead grandma look like? Oh, no! Head! We know. It's just cool to do."
"FIELDY","When are we gonna get to the gig? I'm starving. What the heck starts with the letter P? What? Aw, I hate to see little clowns cry. You're wrong, because there were no pirates in Colorado. So these must be ghosts that have decided to become pirates after the fact. Oh, no! I lost my glasses. My glasses gotta be around here somewhere. Is that you, Jonathan? Boy, I'm glad to see you.

Theh- most likely reason is that... somebody wanted to have sex with her dead body. Uhuh, we don't want to upset you, but it happens. Somebody's probably making love to her corpse as we speak. Yes. By now he's probably even removed her eyes and made love to the empty sockets as well. Yes. And, now for the difficult part. It is highly possible that he has created new orifices in her decomposing flesh, leaving her to look something like ü¾³¤¼ an overloved hunk of Swiss cheese. She probably- ...Do? Yeah, I guess, maybe, you might wanna call the police or something. Now, he probably would make love to the dead body in a cool dry place, so as not to allow further decomposition. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. A person who steals bodies to have sex with them is called a necrophiliac. So that you all know what to expect, my partner Alan has a sketch of what having sex with a dead body might look like. Yes, we know it's horrible. It's probably best you not look at it. Now, Alan will demostrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like. Alright, KoRn, time for you to get out of town! Don't you see that by trying to stop Halloween you've scared the hell out of everybody? They say you can either fight them or join them."
"BLOND","Well, I'm afraid that... somebody dug her up. Yeahp. Every vile position, every disrespectful act imaginable. No-, we don't want to upset you, but you should know that your mother's body would be stiff and dry, so he would have to have it soaked in warm water for several hours before making love to it. Brace yourself. Oh, we don't do anything. We're just the watchmen. Well I'm joining them. Those blanks hurt! I am. I know that. How about if someone made you have sex with your mother and father to save your own life? The father doesn't have a gun? Nice tooth fairy costume. You think anybody'd believe you in that?! How dare you! Yeah."

I spoke with Mr. Hirohito this morning, and he assured me that I have a very large penis. He said it was mammoth, dinosauric, and absolutely dwarfed his penis, which, he assured me, was nearly microscopic in size. My penis, he said, was most likely one of the biggest on the planet. I applaud Mr. Hirohito in his honesty. Thank you."

Well, because, son, public schools are inefficient and dangerous! Mark, public schools are no good! Your mother and I were both home-schooled, and we turned out much better because of it. Alright. Fine, Mark! You go ahead and go to public school! You can just find out for yourself how flawed and treacherous it is! You don't want to go to public school too, do you, Rebecca? Well, thank God for that! At least my daughter will remain safe! Who was that? Oh no. I told you the spelling bee was a bad idea. Yes, but now I think we may have opened a Pandora's box that we can't close! Oh, where could he be? He should've been home from public school by now. That must be him. Oh my God, son! Mark, what have they done to you?! Well, you see? This is what happens at public schools! Well, if we're goin' to let him go back, it looks like I need to have a little talk with those other boys' fathers. Good evening, gentlemen. If I can have your attention for a few moments.  My son Mark was beat up in school today by your sons. I think it would be appropriate for you to talk with your sons, and instruct them to no longer tease or bother my boy. Cotswolds. Well, obviously, they need to be coached a little better.  And furthermore, your son has been harassing my little girl! I would like you to tell him to stop. Uh, hello-o? My girl is eight years old! What does she need to know about love? I will not tell you how to raise your children, and you will not tell me how to raise mine! No, I don't drink beer. I just like wine coolers. I'm sorry, son. There's nothing we can do to stop those bullies. We have to pull you out of public school. Well alright, you can go, but I'll be there to supervise. Mark, where's your sister? Oh, alright. Rebecca, don't play that perverted game! Ah. Alright. Rebecca. But it's time to start your home-schooling! They've got to be here somewhere. Where are my children?! I'm taking them out of this God-forsaken place! Mark. You're absolutely right.  Okay, childdren. If it's what you want, you can start going to public school. What?!"
"MRS. COTSWOLDS","Oooh. Mark, you have play time. You get to play in the afternoon. Yes she is. Oh. Well, I suppose so. Rebecca!  This little boy wants to see you. A little boy wanted to see Rebecca.

We can't torture them. Now, I'll ask you again. Who is the little boy that took our ship? Adopted from whom? Where can we find her?! Oh, I would never say anything. I saw some show where they made fun of Sally Struthers' weight, and I thought it was totally cruel. I mean, she helps people, you know. Uh, heh-his name is Starving Marvin. Hello there, Mr. amd Mrs. Clickclickderk. I think you know why we're here. We are the CIA. That ship needs to be with us! Maybe we should just take something precious of yours, huh?! Daha!  This!

Approximately 31 hours ago, an ethnic-looking child was spotted flying some kind of state-of-the-art space craft over Chinese air space. Alright, children, we just need to know one thing: Do you know this person? Who? This is getting us nowhere. We'll have to resort to more drastic measures. Look, we don't know what that craft is capable of, but the kid is going to have to land it somewhere. God only knows what sadistic backwards Third-World country could get their hands on that ship! Who is this person! Do it again. Sally Struthers! I know exactly where Sall Struthers is. Let them go. I'm warning you, Bill. Sally Struthers is a bit heavy. But don't say anything, because she's pretty sensitive. Ah, Ms. Struthers. Ms. Struthers. We understand you have helped raise millions of dollars to help starving children in Ethiopia. We need information on one of the Ethiopians. You must tell us everything you know about him. Why, yes. It is a chocolate Yum Yum bar, Ms. Struthers , and there are several more where that came from.  Of course, if you don't want to tell us about the Ethiopian boy... I'm... glad we can do business. Here they are! We're with the American government! Sally Struthers told us where we'd find Marvin's parents! Let's go through this one more time, Mr. amd Mrs. Clickclickderk! Your son Marvin has the ship that we want! How can we get it from him? Back away from the space craft, children! You'll do nothing of the kind! This ship is now property of the United States Government! I want everyone to keep a safe distance from the craft until we can run some tests. Look, kid. Did you really think this was going to fool anybody? You don't look anything like Tom Brokaw. Alright boys. Time to get back to your quarters. Son of a bitch! Get 'em! Damnit, damnit, damnit! Ms. Struthers, we understand that you have a ship of your own. One capable of interstellar travel. Oh, that won't be a problem, Ms. Struthers. We have... collateral. Good!

"GOD","What is it, my child? Yea, like John Travolta before you. You are experiencing a second revival. Nay, their eyes are not yet prepared to see the likes of me. Be ye careful of pride, Jesus. I'm sorry, my son, but if you want to earn everyone's love, you will have to do it yourself. Now look upon Me, My children, and know Me.  Be ye not afraid.  Blessed art thou, my children. What did you expect me to look like, My son? Since it is the end of the first 2000 years, I will allow you, My children, to ask me one question. My child, you are a boy. Boys do not get periods. That's only for girls. Your friends were bleeding a little bit out of their asses because of an acute colon infection. And your friend Kyle simply lied about it. You will hit puberty when the time is right. But you will never have a period, because you are a man ü¾³¤¼ with titties. Thus spaketh the Lord. And now I return to heaven. I'll answer another on New Year's Eve, in the year 4000. Yea. Look upon me, and know me. Hello, Satan.  It's- been a long time. What brings you here? Do you wish to mount your unholy war against heaven? You want to rule more than hell? You want to destroy the earth? Jesus, what the hell happened to you? You got kicked out of here for being a headstrong rebel. And now you're a whiny little bitch. No, you've become dependent on relationships. So you haven't even considered the option of not being with either of them.  And if you're not sexually attracted to someone, you're not ever going to be. But Saddam isn't right either. He's the other extreme. You need to spend time alone so that you can find the balance, the middle ground. That's what I always do, because I'm a Buddhist. Bingo. It was nice to see you again, Satan. Good-bye. Saddam. I've been hearing rumors that you're secretly building weapons of mass destruction up here."

"DR. MEPHESTO","Yes, puberty is a very wonderful thing, Stan. It'w what links us all together, makes us one. Never went through puberty? Who never went through puberty? Your father never went through puberty? Oh, I can't say that I blame him. Well, I should think the most logical solution would be... hormones. Yes!  Here, and tell your father to take just one of these pills every week. It could be just what he needs. And be sure to tell him that his secret is safe with me. My pleasure. I just love helping people. I've done it, Kevin. I've successfully spliced this chipmunk with a piece of provolone chese.  Do you know what this means, Kevin? No more will the world have to look in two different places for squirrels and provolone cheese. No more will mankind have to pick- Who could that be?  Why, it's little Eric Cartman. Well of course, come in. Oh, Eric, I'm afraid it's not that simple. Genetic engineering has not yet evolved to the state where I can just make people. Oh. Well, I happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. It's called, NAMBLA. Yes. I have been a member for several years. I'm sure they'd let you join. You l-look about right. Sure!"

"A DENTIST","Dentist office."
"DR. ROBERTS","Oh, yes, Ms. Cartman. What can I do for you? Well, losing baby teeth is a natural thing, Ms. Cartman. How many has he lost? ...A hundred and twelve. Your son wouldn't happen to be an ""alligator,"" would he? No? Hm, I see. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you right now. The American Dental Association convention is this week, but, as soon as I get back, I'll look into it. What? Fellow dentists: As you all know, we are still having numerous reports of missing teeth from all over the country. There are also reports of missing tooth fairy money. We believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this.  A giant half-chickenhalf-squirrel that steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep in order to build some kind of giant nest  for its genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring! We believe also that this creature would have at least a mild understanding of algebra , and that it- ...Yeah. Weh well, by all means, Mr. Foley, enlighten us! Oh, Mr. Foley, you realize how ridiculous that sounds. Where?! And where, pray, is this ""Montreal""?! Uhyub-dub very well, Mr. Foley, you go on your wild goosechase and meanwhile, we'll deal with the real problems at hand. Anyway, the half-chickenhalf-squirrel would most likely be about three to four-and-a-half feet tall. His large beak is probably detachable, and works as a flotation device. Well, I told you!"
"RICH KID","What's going on?  Oh! It's the tooth fairies! I don't have any loose teeth, Miss Fairies but I have been a very good boy."
"LOOGIE","My associates here tell me you were working Cherry Creek tonight. Is that true? Kids have been doing the tooth fairy racket in this town for years.  I do it just like my big brother before me, and my oldest brother before that. Let me ask you something: You were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow? Then what? How are the kid's parents gonna know there was a tooth under their child's pillow? Look, any shmuck can sneak through a window wearing a pretty dress. The tooth racket is much more involved.  We keep careful track of what houses we've hit so that we don't hit the same one twice in less than two months.  Inside the house we not only have to sneak a tooth under the pillow, but leave a note for Mom and Dad to see. The hardest part is getting teeth. We tried various places. Cemeteries , hockey games , anywhere we can find them The teeth we do manage to acquire are then sorted according to size, color, and quality.  But there's never enough teeth. Never enough. And now my only problem is, what do I do with you? Tell you what: how would you like to run the South Park tooth racket for me? It's that, or else I can cut off your penises. I'll cut you in at 2%. They're what?! They're not gonna pay me? Who the hell do they think they are? I want those South Park kids dead! I want their families dead! I want their houses burned to the ground!  Oh, hi there, Mister. My mommy and daddy are out front, if you need 'em. Sit down, Mr. Foley. Do you want some spaghetti? I told the ADA a thousand times: I know nothing about teeth. I'm just an 8-year-old boy who likes climbing trees and playing in puddles. Well then, throw him in. Well, well, well. What do we have here? Did you bastards really think you could hide from me forever? Kolovski , put this buttwipe out of his misery. Aw, drat! It was a trap! Jesus! The little sick kid was a setup all along!  How could I be so stupid?! I can't believe I fell for such an obvious trap! What the hell is wrong with me?! Oh well. Maybe it's good my empire has fallen. Yeah. I kinda wanted to play in the flag football team this year anyways. Naah. In a way, I'm just glad the whole thing's over with."

"THE SOUTH PARK BOYS","Wow!"
"DENTIST","Uh, excuse me? I think I have a more logical theory."
"MR. FOLEY","I think what we've got here is some kind of black-market tooth racket. Something where one group is stealing the money and teeth from another group for a profit. It's not ridiculous. It's very possible. I've seen it happen before. In Montreal. Look, I know how to handle this. All we have to do is bring down the kingpin and the rest will fall. You'll see! I'll have it taken care of in a matter of weeks! Well, I will! Let's cut the crap, kid. My name is Tom Foley. I'm with the American Dental Association. No thanks, I just brushed. I just wanted to let you know that I'm onto you. I am going to find out who the boss is! And when I do I'm gonna bust his ass and everyone's ass who helped hide his ass! Perfect. The trap is set. Thank you for helping out, gentlemen. If this sting operation works, some bogus tooth fairies should be showing up to take the sick kid's money. When they touch the kid's pillow, an alarm will sound, and that's when you hit the button, Murphy, and activate the lights. Everybody got it? Alright. Everyone, keep your eyes peeled. Let's move out! Give it up, kids. You're surrounded by dentists. That's right. And now it's all exposed! You're through! The only thing left to do is to haul all you kids down to prison! What the hell? Let's get outta here!"
"LITTLE CHEF","Ooo, come on, now. Hey, man, I don't need dope. Let me sing you a little song: And that toothpick is gonna turn into an oak tree,... I'ma knock you down, knock you up,... ...knock you over, and knock you all around."
"ODD BOY","That's right, yeah  . It's all top-grade stuff, too.These Chinese kids are selling their teeth for peanuts, see? Well, huh, Tang Li wants 30, but, but I can cut you a deal for 28, yeh ha, buh. Heh, ha-buh, what do you say, huh?"
"WEASEL","Awuh, hawuh, why, sure, sure. Huh?"
"DAN AKAWA","Thanks, Tom. I'm here at the house of little Billy Circlovich, um. Billy is in desperate need of a bone-marrow transplant  or he will most certainly die.  Billy, how much more money do you need for the transplant? Louder, Billy, we can't hear ya! Well, that's a lot of money.How the hell are you gonna get all that in the short amount of time you have left? Well, Billy, I also understand that you lost a tooth today. Billy, we want you to put that tooth under your pillow tonight, because we have a feeling that the tooth fairy is going to leave you six hundred dollars for it! Yes, really.  Six hundred dollars. I might also mention that Billy lives in Crestview Apartments, just off Arapaho Road on Emporia Street. Back to you, Tom.  How was that?"
"BILLY","Sih, six hundred dollar-. Duh six hundred dohollars. Well, I a-I don't know. Yehahah. Really? Okay-y, Mom. G'night, Mom. G'night, Dad. I'm going to bed now, Mommy. I put my tooth under the pillow. Do you really think the tooth fairy will give me money for the transplant? Well, I can't wait to feel healthy and strong again. The tooth fairy!"
"MR. CIRCLOVICH","Really? I think so, Billy. I think so."
"DENTISTS","Got it."
"MURPHY","Duuuh, which button do I hit again, boss?  Just kidding. You know how there's always the dumb guy in sting operations in the movies? I was, you know I was actin', I was actin' like him, eheh, oh. Eh something strange is happening with the computers. Relax, Hopkins!  All fun and games, right?  Soho, tell us, rookies, you ah... find yourself a little bonus in that house?? Come on! We all skim a little off the top. Oh. Or are you too good for that? So you think you're gonna waltz in here and clean up the system. Is that it? LOOK, we all work hard! And we deserve more than the thirty-thousand a year we get paid! So what if we take in a little on the side? Why don't you and your rookie friends make us No problem, sir. No problem at all. So, what did you boys have to say to the lieutenant? Maybe you decided you needed to tell him about our... bonus money. They're dead! That's right. We're partners in the drug business. Everything was fine until these ""supercops"" joined the force. That's right.  I think we'll take a hundred percent now. That's right.  Sometimes partnerships need to end.  Well, supercops, looks like I'll be taking in all the money now. I'm in business alone. And that means that the only person I can't trust... is myself. We're inside, sir. Harris was right. This guy looks like he has more money than all of us put together. Black sonofabitch! I'm planting the cocaine now. We'd better get back to the station, sir. What is it, Lou? Aw, come on, sir. Jesus, how did he...? The killer always cuts off the left hand of his victim, and keeps it as a trophy. Sir? We would give you a reward, but I guess that knowing the people of South Park are safe again is reward enough. All right, here's a hundred dollars. This body also had a missing hand and a bowl of corn flakes next to it! We'll pay you up front this time! We've gotta catch this new guy before he kills again. Quiet! He's havin' a vision! Her name is... Veronica Crabtree, busdriver for the elementary school. She was considered an ancillary character, one the fans wouldn't miss much. Same MO, sir. Multiple stab wounds, left hand cut off and missing. I don't know. How do we know this kid is really psychic? I mean, this boy is certainly no Eric Cartman. ...Sir? ...Restraint? Sarge! In here! Sir? Right. Ohhh. Heh, pretty amazing coincidence that guy had a bunch of hands on his wall. Heh, no wonder that boy thought he was a killer. Heh- sir? Sarge...  What is it? Oh. Uhhh... Oh. Something about hands, sir? Uh for the serial killer? You're certainly a better psychic then Eric. Do you think that's true?"

"AGENT KEEN","We're here to investigate the rock-throwing incident. New laws have been passed that make any crime based on race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation a federal offense. We're sorry, Ms. Cartman, but we must follow protocol.  Your son will be taken into custody and then tried in a federal court of law."
"AGENT SHARP","I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that, Mr. School Counselor.You see, since the victim in this case is African-American, this is considered a hate crime."
"LESLIE","What turns a normal, fat little eight-year-old boy into a vicious, hate-crime-commiting racist? We take you live to the courtroom as the defendant takes the stand."
"BLACK BAILIFF","Yes, sir."
"WHITE BAILIFF","Alright, you! ...Uh-uh-uh, where'd he go?"
"GREG NIMINS","Tom, it looks like the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading east on 285. Police officers are right behind him  but as with any chase, they're keeping a safe distance to avoid any accidents here out on the highway.  Tom, it looks like the fugitive is going to make a bold move off an exit off 285. He's going into a residential neighborhood now; this is where it could get dangerous, as there are pedestrians about. Tom, the police have set a roadblock right where the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading.  This could be the final stand-off. Well, it's been over thirteen hours now, and still the car chase has not ended. The chase has now moved through most of Arizona and nears the Mexican border."
"WARDEN","Prisoner 24601, arriving.  Forward, prisoner! You will wake up each morning at 0500.  Lockdown is until 0900. At ten we begin random searches and checks for contraband.  At 11:30 we have naptime, followed by finger-painting. Your cellmate is Romper Stomper! Josh Meyers TP'ed over six hundred houses in less than a year.  He's a real monster. Just remember: he'd toilet-paper you in a second if he had the chance.  He's the last cell on your left. Josh,  were you doing the silly voice for the policeman again? Everything that you had when you were first brought in here will now be returned. One Crayole eight-pack with crayon sharpener. One pair of plastic round-tipped scissors. One marble, blue. And one switchblade knife with ""Kill all betrayers"" written on the blade, black.  Trent! Where are you gonna do?"
"ROMPER STOMPER","I am!  And I don't want no new cellmate! Oh, I will!  You bet your ass I will. Well, well, well. Nwe fish. How about you come up with a reason why we don't break your arms?! Oh yeah? The way I see it, there's two kinds of kids in the world: kids who like Animaniacs, and kids who don't like Animaniacs. You're either with us, or you're against us. So which are you?! ...Neither do we No! There's no friends in the Big House! You come in with nobody and you leave with nobody. We don't believe in ""friends."" Now, go find me some cigarettes and I'll tell you how to bust out of here. Well, did you get the cigarettes? Alright. Go sit on the toilet and poop them out. I'll keep an eye out for the guards. You flushed them?! No way, douche. I told you: I ain't your friend. If you want me to help you, you're gonna have to sneak something else in for me. Cool! My very own Tic-Tac-Throw game. Ew, it smells, man. You're not gonna break out of here! You're here 'til you're 21, douche! I just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. What? You actually think I give a crap about you? Hneah. You'd better wise up to the way things work in the big house.  Hey guys! I gots me a new Tic-Tac-Throw  Yeah, it's a little ripe, but it's brand new, man! You can play it at recess.  Hey. Uh, what are you doing?  You... you can't cry in prison, man. They'll bust your head open. What's the matter with you?! Dude. Look, if it's that important to you, I'll bust you out of here. Yeah. ...Yyeah, I will. Uh-but not because you're my friend. Only because... because I wanna bust out, too. Anh-anh, and see Disneyland. Hurry up! They're sending the dogs after us!  Mph. Oowww! It's my leg! I think it's broken. You go on ahead without me. Hey.  You're supposed to say, ""I'm not going without you,"" or something. Look, kid, you go on. You've got something to live out there. You've got friends. I sure would have liked to have seen Disneyland. Here. I want you to have these. No! You're supposed to say, ""I can't take these,"" or something, dumbass! Take them. They'll bring you luck. Now go on. Get out of here. Yeah? Eric! Wow! I've never had a visitor before! You did? Yeah."

"CLINIC DOCTOR","Alright, this is a very sinple test which should determine without a doubt whether or not Timmy has Attention Deficit Disorder. Egh. Now, Timmy, I'm going to read you a book called, ""The Great Gatsby,"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. At the end of the novel I'll ask you a few questions. Are yiou ready? Okay, here we go.  ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since""  ""so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" Okay now, Timmy. Can you tell me: In Chapter 7, what kind of car did Gatsby drive? Well, that settles it! This young man definitely has Attention Deficit Disorder! Well, ADD is fairly common in kids today. I'm gonna prescribe some Ritalin, and we'll see how that goes for little Timmy. ""After a while I went out and left the hospital, and walked back to the hotel in the rain.""  Alright now, in Chapter 12, what kind of bottles did Miss Van Campen talk about?  Anybody?  Anybody?? My God, these children all have ADD! It's Ritalin for all of you! That's easily another twenty grand apiece! Well, they've all been diagnosed with ADD. That's Attention Deficit- Huh? Hey now, don't tell us our business, Mr. Chef. Why, we- Mm- my God. What have we done?? We uh... have to convince them not to take it, but, ahah ih it'll be hard to get it away from them. Uh, what's the antidote for Ritalin?"
"OTHER CLASSMATES","Yeah, I've got it. Me too. Yeah. It's gay."
"ALL THE KIDS","Hooray."
"DRUMMER","Dude, we suck!"
"PHARMACIST","There is your prescription, Ms. McCormick. A hundred dollars' worth of Ritalin. We can only hope so. Next? Next, please?  What do we have here- ah! The Ritalin! Oh, no no no, your son may experience a small lack of energy, but that's all. Oh, and he might start seeing little pink Christina Aguilera monsters, but that's to be expected. Look at that. Ritalin stocks are up ten points. Can I help you? Eh wuh, what?? Well, if I had known... Phl Collins, uh, my God! Yes, of course. I have some right here.  It's a compound called ""Ritalout."" Can I help you, young lady? Oh, you want some morning-after abortion pills. Well, they're right over there. Uh, I'm sorry, young lady, but I can't sell that to you without permission from your parents. Can I help you boys? Condoms. How old are you boys? Sorry, kids, I'm not selling you condoms. I just don't think kids your age should be- Can I help you boys? Whoa, boys! That's not what you need to come up with ideas. No! What you want is Calminex PM.  It has the dexatrimfan in it that causes hallucinations in large doses. Now, if it's more of a lucid, speedy kind of high you're looking for, I do also carry the Daytab Cold and Flu. Then there's the maximum-strength Cortitussin Cough and Cold, but of course, that's only if you really want to trip balls. That's the spirit! All right, boys, I'll just need your parents' permission. Kidding! I'm just pulling your legs. Come on over to the register."

"CHARLIE ROSE","Tonight, we analyze the new rock sensation, Timmeo , the controversial new band that has taken the country by storm. Already playing at several large venues this month , the band prepares for its biggest gig, Lolapalooblaza, where they will open for Phil Collins. But Phil Collins is not happy."
"PHIL COLLINS","Well, I thinks it's a horrible tragedy, idn't it? I mean, people aren't gonna see Timmy for his musical skills. They're laughin' at 'im, and I think you shouldn't laugh at people with disabilities! Society has to learn how to be more compassionate! This is gonna stop if I have to stop it myself! Well, I think the sad question is, ""Where are the parents in all this?"" I mean, that kid's parents are lettin' him be exploited, and they don't even seem to care. Well, I mean, why are you lettin' 'em do this to your son? Don't you see that everyone's just laughin' at him? Excuse me, Skyler Moles? Nice to meet you. I'm Phil Collins. I just wanted to tell you that, well, I think that you're a great guitar player and song writer. It's too bad those other guys are holdin' you back. Well, I mean, it's obvious all the talent and artistic vision in the band comes from you. Strange, how everyone focuses n Timmy, idn't it? I mean, even the name of the band is ""Timmy,"" Look, I used to be in a band, too. Genesis. And all those bastards did was hold me back and hold me back. But then, finally, I went solo. And that's when I started writing really great songs. But look, if you happen to be on the sidelines, you know, bein' more of a cheerleader than a player, well, then I guess you should stay on as Timmy's shadow. That should just about put an end to all this Timmy nonsense.  PHIL COLLINS Last night I went, ""O!"" I know. I'd like to sing the complex and amazing song that won me the Oscar, a song entitlted, ""You'll Be In... Me."" Thanks. Well, thanks! Shut your filthy holes, you little bastards! You just wanna laugh at him."
"KURT LODER","Why am I still doing this? I've got to be the oldest person in this network by at least 40 years. Well, it's only two weeks until Lalapalalababa, and the headlining band has changed. Now headlining the event is Timmy , the new hit sensation out of Colorado. This news came as a shock to the performer that was going to headline Lalapalabala, Phil Collins. And so, Phil Collins decided to travel to South Park and personally pay Timmy's parents a visit. Phil Collins warns that a novelty band that makes fun of the handicapped should not be allowed to play Lalapalablalala, and vows to do everything in his power to stop it. Phil Collins, by the way, divorced his wife via fax and then married a 27-year-old. I'm Kurt Loder, and that's the news. Welcome back to MTV. We're here with the members from Radiohead, probably the hottest band in the world right now.  Guys, when is the next album coming out? And will there be a new tour?"
"A SINGER","Thank you, South Park! Good night!"

"ANCHOR TOM","...until the U.S. government receives this video, which was sent from Romania just hours ago. It's been over three hours since the police first showed up on the scene of a handicapped boy's wheelchair set with explosives. The child can't stop or get off the chair without risking explosion, and so the SWAT team will now attempt to disarm the device. Last night, the daring and bold show, Cop Drama , broke new ground by saying ""SHIT"" on television, making ""shit"" officially okay to say around the country. A recent poll shows that 24% of Americans think the show has pushed the envelope too far, while a whopping 76% say they don't really give a shit.  In other news, a strange virus which causes victims to vomit up their intestines is making life shitty for a small farming community. Rick Watts has the story. The Colorado Little League State Championship is being played this week. Two teams of youngsters get to go head to head at the major-league stadium downtown. A tragic event is unfolding in South Park. Three convicted murderers have escaped from jail and are holding twelve people at the Red Cross!"
"A FAN","Yeah. Woo hoohoohoo. Yeah. We like to praise Christ!"
"JANET RENO","Yes, but the girls seem to wanna stay here. Why don't you all stay here in America, and this whole thing can go away. Gentlemen, this has to be handled very delicately. You don't understand Americans' power to protest. Look, people have it so good in America that they get bored very easily. And when people get bored they start protesting things. But I want to assure you, and the Romanian people, that we are going to do everything in our power to make this as confusing as possible. Right. ""Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny."" Ready. Code blue! Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny. Happy Easter, kids. Come see what I brought for ya. This is a bust! Hand over the quints! Hand over the children! Happy Easter. Hand over the children!!

"NAMBLA LEADER","And now that all ethnic groups, homosexuals and womens are protected under civil-rights laws,  we want the same! What we need is proof that young boys want to be members of NAMBLA. That they want love from us. We need a poster child, to show the world that it is a beautiful and wonderful thing and a-  Can we... help you? You... do? Oho, thank you. Thank you, Jesus. Uh hey, Eric, we have a surprise for you. We want to have a big dinner and dance honoring you as our new poster child. Yes, and and we you to um... invite all your young male friends. Great, hnn. You go invite your little friends, and we'll get the hotel ready. Fellow NAMBLA members, it is great to see you all here. It seems like we have finally found a city that won't oppress us. First and foremost, I wanna recognize Eric Cartman, for putting us in touch with all of you pretty, young boys. Now, I know that many of us have already found partners in this fahine city, and I'd like to take a minute to hear some testimonials from members. Ho, goodness! What a gift from God! Aha ha, we'll... ""get"" ...to it very soon, I assure you. But first, I'd just like to hear from a couple of you on your progress. Uh yes, Patrick. Wonderful, heh hn. And how about you, Mr. Harris? Wuhell, members, I know we're all eager to get acquainted with our new partners and, so why don't we turn down the lights and start to dance! Alright, members, that's enough of that.  It's time for all of us to retire to our respective rooms, and get to know our new young boys. Everyone come up and grab your room keys and we'll head upstairs, hm hm. It's clear. The cops are gone. Where's the boys?! Maybe the boys are in here. Oh bo-oys? Oh, one of the boys just came in. Rights? Does anybody know their rights? You see, I've learned something today. Our forefathers came to this country because... they believed in an idea. An idea called ""freedom."" They wanted to live in a place where a group couldn't be prosecuted for their beliefs. Where a person can live the way he chooses to live.  You see us as being perverted because we're different from you. People are afraid of us, because they don't understand. And sometimes it's easier to persecute than to understand. We are human. Most of us didn't even choose to be attracted to young boys. We were born that way. We can't help the way we are, and if you all can't understand that, well, then, I guess you'll just have to put us away."

"MR. WYLAND","Now, I understand that some students in this class like to mess with substitute teachers.  But if we all behave and respect each other, I'm sure we can make this a fun and productive day. Let's start with roll call. Let's see, mmmmm.  Eric Cartman? Alright, and how about Stan Marsh? Okay, and where iiiiss... Kenny McCormick? Alright. Look, why don't we skip roll call? Here's what we're gonna do today. I've been told that one of your classmates has been ill for several days ü¾³¤¼ Kyle Broflovski? Well, I've been told that in Mr. Garrison's absence, our activity for the day is to make a get-well card for Kyle. So I got this large piece of poster board, and we're all gonna come up and use glitter.and glue to decorate it. Kenny, you come and decorate the get-well card, too. I don't care! Get down here and do it! Okay, children, in Mr. Garrison's absence, I would like to turn the class's attention to current issues. Some people think the South Park flag should be changed, while others believe that changing the flag is wrong. I think this is a perfect subject for your debate club. I see that you've already had a lot of interesting debates this year.  Pro-Choice vs. Cartman, Pro-Gun Control vs. Cartman, a-and People Against the Clubbing of Baby Seals vs. Cartman. And apparently, the winner of all your debates so far has been... Cartman. Alright, children, well, unlike Mr. Garrison, I want you all to go out and research this debate before we pick teams. Tomorrow, you'll need to choose which side of this poignant debate you are on. Well I've counted up all your secret ballots, childen, and it look like about half of you think the flag should stary, and half think the flag should be changed. Save it for the debate, Wendy. Now I'm going to assign the debate leaders. Who wants to lead the ""Flag Should Stay The Way It Is"" team? Alright, children. Do your homework, and let's get ready for a great debate! Well I certainly would like to thank all the parents for their support of our debate club.  I r-realize that many of you are torn by the issues as well, so, perhaps the children can shed some light on us. We'll start with Wendy Testaburger on the ""Flag Should Be Changed"" team. Okay, and Kyle and Stan's team, your main point? What?"
"BOARD MEMBER","Frankly, your conduct has been somewhat disconcerting. All we're saying is, perhaps you should take a little hiatus from teaching until this little  ""child molestation"" thing dies down a bit."
"MISS INFORMATION","You see, the reason our body is stale is because of toxins. All the horrible food we eatü¾³¤¼the sodas and meats are filled with toxins, and the only way for us to get better is to flush those toxins out of our system. Western medicine is so quick to cut and carve up, but all your son needs is a  toxin-flushing diet of lemon juice and cayenne pepper. What? Mrs. Broflovski, I would like to give your son herbs that focus on the kidney. I have these excellent herbs from local Native Americans. Good morning, everyone. Huuuuuuuuuh  Oh, I don't agree. He seems much better. Yes, his chi is flowing much nicer than yesterday, and his aura is lighter. Nono, that's good. Those are the toxins flushing out of the system. Now, don't be fooled. As Kyle's body sheds itself more and more of all the toxins he will appear to be getting worse, but actually, he is getting better! Oh, look eveyone. These are our two resident Native Americans. Chief Running Pinto, and Carlos Ramirez. Native Americans are more in tune with the earth than we are. Mrs. Broflovski's son is a little sick. Perhaps she could bring him in tomorrow and you could give him some spiritual healing. Why don't you follow me over to the cash register and I'll take a deposit. Good-bye, Native Americans. The spirit of Maya is with you. Well, of course the doctor told you that, because he wants to make money. Holistic modicine is about NATURE. Two-hundered and thrity-three dollars. And next we have Mrs. Broflovski's son. Yes. He really needs his toxins flushed again. Uh, toxins ARE your enemy."
"SSHEILA","Toxins?"
"BLONDE MOTHER","Yes, poor little dear. Oh, thanks for coming, Miss. Information. Kyle seems to be getting worse."
"OTHER MOTHERS","I agree. Yeah. That's right."
"CARLOS RAMIREZ","Oohh, oh yeah. Aah...  Here, uh, this is a ahh dream...catcher. Oh yeah, the earth is great. uh'hm, ho ho hm. Oh yah. You too and junk. Oh, here, try this, man. Ah, this is allll-naturalll ball juice. No, man, that kid needs a doctor! And besides, we're not actually Native Americans. I mean, I'm I'm more like a, a Mexican. Yeah. A Mexican. Yeah. She said nobody would buy anything from Mexicans. Funny."
"CHIEF RUNNING PINTO","Yeah. And these here are Cherokee hair tampons. They're, like, tampons made with all-natural hair from the Cherokee people. Oh yeah. We love the earth, man. Oh, sure. We could do that, man. We'll give him, like, a, a brain enema, or somethin'. Sure, uh, we just gotta go back to our truck- I'm, I mean our horses and grab some more junk.  Come on. That's funny, man. No problem, man. Pay Miss Information up front. Ahahem, that kid looks really sick. No. I mean, he look REALLY sick, man. You should take him to, like, a doctor. Look, bein' in touch with the earth has nothing to do with dyin', man. Hey, we never said we were Native Americans, man. Miss Information said that. Yeah.  Hey, man, we're glad you're getting better, too."

No. No, this is what we in the book-publishing business like to call... gay. Really, really gay. It's just that the focus really seems to be on the... male organs. It is. Hmmm."
"MOVER","Look out!  Oops."

My name's Gary. That's funny. You're cool, man. Oh! Oh oh oh! Nineteen sixty nine! Oh hey there! You wanna kick the ball around with me? 'Scuse me? How come you wanna fight me? ...Oh, I get it. I'm the new kid.  Yeah, I guess maybe I deserve it. It's really tough being in a totally new place, but I think all you guys are really cool so... I understand if there's initiation rites. The other kids are watching. Look, do what you gotta do. I won't fight back. I just hope that maybe afterwards we can... try to be friends someday. Hey everybody! This is my new friend Stan. Stan, this is my mom and dad. And this is my brother Mark. My sister Jenny. My little brother Dave. And my baby sister Amanda. That's when we don't allow any TV and just entertain each other with music and stories. Doesn't your family ever do that? Yeah yeah, yeah, I love my family! can pass the test. Yeah! You know... the book that Joseph Smith found. Tell us the story of Joseph Smith, Dad. Awesome! I can't wait! You coming, Stan? Bye! Hey Stan. Hey guys. Stan, I remember you said last night that you'd lost your wallet, so I made you a new one.  I carved a picture of John Elway into the leather on the front. Hey! My family's on their way over to the fire station to donate blood. You wanna come along? Oh here comes my family now! Oh. Well, I'd like to, but... Oh man, I would miss you guys so much! So what do you guys wanna do? Oh cool! I'm gonna do that tomorrow. So hey, I heard your dad came over last night and he and my dad talked about Joseph Smith. That's great! Sure. Well, he kept them hidden from everyone like he was told. And then he translated what was written on the plates into the Book of Mormon. Hey everybody. Hey Stan. Hey, that's only cool, guys. You can believe whatever you want! Yeah! Hooray for the Marshes! Hey Stan. Listen, I just wanted to let you know you don't have to worry about me tryin' to be your friend anymore. Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe Joseph Smith did make it all up, but I have a great life."
"WALTER","Satan, a few of us are gonna go pound some brews. You wanna join us? Oh, well, maybe next time. Great luau!"
"CHRIS","Yeah? Uuh, no, but there's still some boxes coming from the movers. Is that the movers, Satan? Oh, well, tell them I'm leavin' their check on the counter. Those were some great pork chops, Satan. Hey, you.  You've been actin' strange all night. What's up? Well, it's... just that you've washed that same dish seven times now, silly. Come on, Satan. You know you can tell me anything. What's up? Oh.  Woww!  I wasn't ready for that. I thought you... killed him. ...Do you still love him? It's okay of you do. Well, you know what I think we should do? I think we should all get together and just talk, like adults. We're all grown men here, Satan. I wanna just go meet this guy. Oh, I know he's got the whole bad-boy thing going. But I think that's what you were attracted to. But I can be a pretty rough tumbler myself.  Oops! Aw, butternuts! There you are. I've been lookin' all over for you. I have to tell you somethin' that might make you... a little mad. Well, I called Saddam Hussein and invited him over for dinner tonight. I just think we all need to get this out in the open. Come on, Satan. We're all adults here. He was an important person in your life, for better or for worse. So, I wanna know him. If he sees that I'ma real person too, then... well, maybe he'll see how happy we are together. Satan, we're not in junior high school anymore. Oh, hello. You must be Saddam Hussein. Oh, thank you. Satan, what the heck is wrong with you? Well, come on in. Dinner's just about ready. So Saddam. Satan told me all about how you guys almost took over the world once. Oh, well I, I actually slipped down an escalator, in a mall. Those things can be pretty sketchy. L-look, Saddam, I know that you and Satan had a relationship  And I just want you to know  that I'm totally okay with you guys staying friends. I think it's important to stay friends with people you've had relationships with.  And I know that Satan and my relationship is strong enough that it can handle anything.  Right?  Right. Hoof. Well, I don't know about you guys, but all that ginger made me tired. Nice to meet you, Saddam! Have a safe walk back! Goodnight Yeah.  That's hot.  You take it!  You take it now! I'm just... I'm just trying to be a little more naughty in bed. I uh... I know that's what you like about sex with Saddam. I'm just... showin' you that I can be that way, too. Uh huh. Yeah. You like that, don't you, bitch?  I'm a bad boy. Yeah. Take that. But it turns you on. But what? Okay. I love you, Satan. It's okay. It's okay. I, uh, I, I understand. ...I do. Yeah. Sure. Okay. I love you, Satan. Hey you. You... were out all night. Satan. You know you're not a very good liar. You went and saw Saddam, didn't you? Satan, I understand. I still feel secure and safe with you. What? What's wrong? I said it's okay. Well, what more do you want from me? Satan, I'm a Nineties man. I cry when I need to. I share my feelings and I keep my mind open about everything. Now you're starting to hurt my feelings. Aaaah! Satan!  'Scuse me. Excuse me. Yeah, well, where was I gonna go? Detroit? Hey, it's alright. All that matters is that I'm back, and we're together forever. Right? Yeah. It's me. Yeah, Do you have a couple of minutes to go for a walk? Yeah. Just real quick. Around the park or somethin'. No, I just want you to go for a quick walk with me. Please? Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't like me very much. Look, Satan is a very important person to me. And I know he's an important person to you, too. So don't you think it's best for us to just- try and get along? I realize that some things about me bother you. So I'd like to hear what those things are so that I can work on them. Aaaah!  Oh God! Nooo! Agh! Ow!  Goo-aagh! Ow! Aaaah! You have? Satan. Can we go for a walk in the park? Fine. Mr. Cartman, congratulations, the theme park is yours. He sure did! Oh no.  No! No, no, Jesus! Linda, what were you thinking? This can't be happening! This is a bad dream. No! Linda, we- Linda, Butters is gone.  Oh Christ, if Butters is gone, then... there's nothing we can do about that. But I won't let you go to jail, I promise, Linda! Pleeease! Well, our son was ab-ducted. We don't know that he's dead yet. Yes, it, it sure is. Yes, I'd I sure hope we do. Naw, Linda! Because you can't now say that the abductor is Costa Rican!  You have to learn to keep it straight! Hey, don't forget that I'm covering for you! My lies may have been deceitful, but your lies cover up something much more horrible than anything I ever did! Not now, Butters! Son! I don't believe it! No-huih, no, Butters. Oh, son, why... Oh... Uh, we're gonna need you to tell a little white lie about where you've been though, alright? No! You have to say that a Puerto Rican man dropped you off! Now we don't really have a choice, do we?! Well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description, stupid! ...Butters... You're as right as rain. You bet, son. But Mommy and Daddy have something they have to do first. We... have an announcement to make, um. Our son has been returned to us. But, that isn't all we have to say. You see, we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us. You see, I've been deceiving my wife for several months. I was going to gay movie- and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers. So you see, there was no ""some Puerto Rican guy."" He doesn't exist. And so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the Ramseys, Congressman Condit, and O.J. We gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you and, we're sorry. Now we're just happy we won't have to live a life of secrets. For I knew that even though some of you supported us, some others were looking at me and thinking, ""You're a liar! You're a LIAR!""  ""You know somethin' that you're not telling us, you slimy, scumbag LIAR!!""  Eh you know, that's what people would say to me. And then people would see my wife at the supermarket and they would say, ""Hello,"" but they'd be thinking, ""Ah, there goes that MURDERER!"" ""You got away with MURDER you murdering, lying, waste of life!!""  And to me, people might say things like,  ""LIAR! Tell us what you know you God-damned LIAR!!""  And so, to both of us, people all over town would be saying things like,  ""You know God-damn well what happened to your kid, so stop acting like victims, and confess, you MURDERING MURDERERS!!""  ""CONFESS!!""  ""LIAR!! CONFESS!!"" You know, and, that's what people would be saying to us, and so, we just had to come forward and tell the truth. And now, if you'll excuse us, this family has to get to Bennigan's. Butters. Are you having liposuction surgery? Tell me the truth! Well, I guess that wasn't enough! You get up to your room right now, mister! Oh huh don't you give us that look young man! You're gonna get it! I'm just checkig in on you, Butters. Heh- Do I hear the television? We told you no television while you're grounded! Jacking it? Jacking what? What?! Are you trying to get yourself in more trouble with that kind of language?! Oh!! You are gonna get it, mister!! You just wait till I get home!1 Don't you ""Hi, Mom and Dad!"" us, you little punk!! Yeah. We figure that if our boys are goona be great friends, we should all get to be friends, too. Well, our son is a perfect void-filler. It's nice that he finally has your sons to be his best buddies! And we were thinking, since they've all become such close friends, how great it would be for us to all go together to Aspen for a ski weekend. No, you see, Linda and I found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in Aspen if you attend a time-share presentation.. Yes! And all we have to do is attend a thirty-minute meeting! Hey boys! We're all going to Aspen fior the weekend! Here we are, everyone. Where are Butters and Eric? Butters? Eric? Come on! We gotta get to the powder! Okay. We'll meet you boys on the slopes. It sure it. What's the red sticker? A-all right! Yes, we have the special passes to use the exclusive lift from the time-share comapny? Have fun waiting in line, suckers! Woohoohoo! I hope you don't blame me for all that. I mean, the ad ...did... just say a thirty-minute presentation. Uh we got a little held up at the time-share sales office. What's the matter? Didn't you boys like skiing? Well, sorry isn't gonna make it this time, mister! You know, your grandmother saw the show and had a mild stroke! Ugh! You'd better believe you won't, buster! Whoa-ho-ho, let, let me try.  Butters? Butters, this is your father. Butters? Answer me! Butters! Right now! WHAT?! What's gotten into them? I'll say! Why sure, Butters. I was just about to get some breakfast. Alright, then, it's settled. Tomorrow we'll find an outside counselor and... find out the truth. Yeah, let's kill God, yeah! ...Same thing. Well, I guess this means the enemy is in our own backyard, so to speak. Alright, thanks, Chris. Is the weather going to turn su- Us?? Your family's all be the shifty-eyed ones! Oh, son, can you ever forgive us? Oh. Yeah, the Mongolians were right. Yeah. Oh, hello boys. Well, thank you very much, kind heroes. Oh, but you are noble heroes! We know our thanks is enough. Butters,  look what we have for you to watch: the Lord of the Rings. That's our man. Here you go. Oh, hello Randy, Sharon. What's the matter? Butters? Butters, where is the movie you were watching? Back Door Sluts 9 makes Crotch Capers 3 look like Naughty Nurses 2! Come on Jimmy, we don't have a lot of time. The video stockyard. Staples. They went to the video Staples. Where's that, Jimmy? Uh huh. Dumbass! Now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant the respect they deserve. Right? Shut your mouth, Butters! You'll speak when spoken to! Mr. Mackey, we've done everything we can to raise compassionate children. We don't know where else to turn. Come on, let's go. What the hell is this?! Butters! Do you have an explanation for this?! What, uh-? My God. You're right, Linda. This is what we get for deceiving our son. Butters, listen. The whole future self thing, well, it was a dirty fib. We though the ends justified the means, but they don't. They just... don't, son! Well well well! I had to see it to believe it! Don't you ""Hi, Dad"" me! Look at you! Standing behind prison bars! Again! Butters was with us all night, Officer Barbrady. And that's your excuse?! Just wait till we get you home, you little fibber! Oooo, little crime stoppers, huh? Well, I'm afraid I don't have any crimes I need solved right now. I'll do that. Have fun, boys. Well, come on, honey, I guess we should start packing up our things as well. A dog parade? Hello everyone. Have any of you seen our son? We know, but... he hasn't been home since last night. The police have been looking everywhere, but...  Well, thank you. Uh, please, let us know if you find out anything. And she's... a... girl, right? Well all right! Good for you, Butters! Yes. Those boys are quite imaginative. Leave it to them to find a fun way to do the dishes. It's good to see Butters finally have a friend that wants to stay over. What kind of work do you do, Mr. Jefferson? I think he's definitely going to jail. I just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance. Butters? Butters, what is wrong with you?? Butters, we have had it with your moping around! You're gonna go outside and you're gonna play, right now! Butters, play!  Start playing right now, young man! Just keep the door locked, honey. Butters can't be a house hermit his whole life. What happened to him, Doctor? Now, honey, we were trying to read. Butters, never get into a car with a stranger! Unless it's a limosine. Butters, will you mind telling us why you're dressed up like a bear?! Your girlfriend? Uh, sweetheart, isn't Paris Hilton worth a lot of money? Yes, and more than three billion times his net worth. Everybody adores that girl, darling. We should be nice to her too, especially if she's in love with our son! So, Paris, I understand you're from the prestigious Hilton family. Very nice hotels. Butters is our son. He's not for sale. Escuse me?! Aj, Butters, why don't you take Paris up to your room for a little while, uh, Mommy and Daddy have to talk. Butters, right now!! Darling, Paris is a billionaire. She can give Butters everything he wants. We'd be terrible parents NOT to consider it. I know, darling, but look: we have to think about the rest of the family. Yes, us, the rest of the family. Ms. Hilton? Uh, Ms. Hilton. Ms. Hilton, we've talked it over all night and ...while your offer is enticing, I'm afraid we just can't sell you our son for two hundred million dollars. It'll have to be two hundred and fifty million, cash, up front. All right, Butters, tell you what: if you can raise the two hundred and fifty million dollars yourself, you can stay. It's called ""working"" young man! Your grandfather was a coal miner for fifty years; he never complained! Get out there and start digging! That should keep him busy for a while while we get this transaction finished. Now, Ms. Hilton, how should we start? Well Butters, how'd it go? Did you dig up two hundred million dollars' worth of coal? Oh, well, too bad.  Ms. Hilton did raise the money, so you'll be going off with her. Oh that troublemaking son of ours! Butters! Butters, you get back here or you are grounded, mister! So- so that's it? No two hundred million dollars? Well, Butters, I hope you're happy! You're grounded, old bear."
"NUN","Hello, children. I'm Sister Anne. And I'll be teaching you so that you can all receive your First Communion."
"SISTER ANNE","Well, hopefully not. That's why you're gonna need to receive Communion. It doesn't matter, because we are all born with Original Sin. Now, let me explain how Communion works.  The priest will give you this round cracker,  and he will say, ""The Body of Christ,"" and then you eat it. No. Yes. In the Book of Mark, Jesus distributed bread and said, ""eat this, for it is my body."" Nononono! The Body of Christ! No! Look: all you have to know is that when the priest gives you the cracker, you eat it! Okay?! And then, you will drink a very small amount of wine, for that, is the Blood of Christ. Eric, do you wanna go to hell?! Then stop questioning me. No. Because before you can take your first Communion, you have to have your first Confeesion. You'll be getting in the Confession box with a priest and confessing all your sins, so that God can forgive you. You kids will all have to go to your first Confession this Tuesday, so I want you all to go home tonight and think long and hard about all your sins, so that you can tell the priest everything. Oh, hello, children. Okay, shoot. The handicapped are just people like you and me, so the same rules apply. They need to be baptized, take Communion, and confess their sins. Uugh. This really isn't a question for me, it's for the priest.  I'll see if I can find him. Bye. Father! I need to talk to you. Father! I have to ask you a question. Father, the children asked me about their handicapped friend. I wanna explain to them that he's fine. Father, these boys are really worried because they think they have to- Yes, but- Father- Father, I don't know if I agree fully with what you're saying. I think that as long as Jewsih people are good, they will get into heaven. Yes. The priest here has been telling the children some pretty radical things, and I just wanted to see what the Church thinks about Jews and the mentally handicapped. Hello, His Holiness. I want to ask you about people with mental disabilities. Do mentally-challenged people go to hell? Handicap. Mental handicap. ...The priest here said that people with mental handicaps might end up in hell. Is that true? Oh no. Eric, you need to stop what you're doing. You need to tell all the kids to go back to school, and back to their normal lives. Yes, Eric. A lot more than you have. Eric, the Lord just doesn't send everybody to hell. That wouldn't make sense. He wants people to live their llives. No. Uugh.  Wait a minute. That's it. Alright kids, it's time to go! It's time for this to stop! I know you won't listen to me. That's why I brought somebody else."
"SECRETARY","Yes, I understand you want to speak-a wit the pope. Yes, well the pope is here, but please keep it brief. He is a-very old."
"THE POPE","Heh?? Heh? Ehhhhh, what's that you say?  Heh?! Fibibiibibibibiibibih. Eh-bibibiibibibibiibibibih."
"DAMNED SOUL","Oh, the pain! Oh, the pain!"
"RICHIE","Fonz, there's no way you can jump that shark with your water skis. I told him he couldn't do it."
"JOANIE","Go Fonz!!!"
"DAUGHTER","Dad?"
"STEPHEN","Where, where am I? O-hoo no Butters! You got an advance two days ago. Girlfriend? Don't worry, Butters. We just wanna say hi and then we'll leave you two alone. You see? I told you he wouldn't turn out gay. I, don't know. Oh boy, I think I know what's happened. Our son hasn't learned yet that girls will pretend to like him for money. Uh, Butters, can we have a little talk with you? Outside? You see, Butters, women know that they can make men do anything by flirting. And some girls, like these, turn that into a profession. I think it's best we try to reason with it. Who's seeing dead people? Now, Butters, there's no such thing as ghosts. Butters, these things happen all the time. You've got a very active little brain and your mind was just playing tricks on you. Yeess. That's right. There's no reason to be afraid of things that aren't real. There's plenty of real things to be scared of. Like super-AIDS. That's right. A new form of AIDS which is resistant to drugs. Just one teaspoon of super-AIDS in your butt and you're dead in three years. So now you feel better? Ghosts don't exist and there's nothing to be afraid of. Except the super-AIDS. Butters, what is going on?! Well you'd better stop having nightmares or eles you're gonna be grounded! Butters! What have you done?! No, I think you'd better call a doctor. I'll ground him. Now do you believe us, Butters? There's our boy."
"HELL DIRECTOR","Yes, well I'm afraid you were wrong. I'm afraid it was the Mormons. Yes, the Mormons were the correct answer. So now I'd like to quickly introduce your new ruler and master for eternity, Satan! Uh, okay. Thank you Satan. Now, uh, let's begin with the Muslims..."
"TELEVANGELIST","...And I'm gonna save all of you right now.  I'm gonna heal your sins-eh."
"BLONDE GIRL","Wow, that really sucks. Well, there is one person who I always used to ask when I needed advice. God. Well then, maybe it's time. Me neither. I have to have sugar or I'm going to die. Two donuts and a pack of licorice, please. We did it!"
"UGLY GIRL","Yes!! Waah."
"MORMONS","Alright. Yeah. Ooooo! Me, too. Uh huh. Oooo, yeah. I'll do that."
"YOUNGER BOY","What? Thi-ird Uhuhuhow."
"NEW TEACHER","Alright, children, quiet down. Welcome to the fourth grade. My name is Ms. Choksondik."
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Play time is over, children! Do you understand me?!  I don't know how your last teacher behaved, but this is the fourth grade!  And it is time to go to work! Well, young man, I hope you have a good explanation for this. This is the fourth grade! You need to grow up! Now, get back to your desk and write a thousand-word essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class. Now, let us begin our first-day exam. SILENCE! Principal Victoria, I would like a word! My new students are the most misbehaved, illiterate, brain-dead group of children I have ever come across! One of them is mentally handicapped, for Christ's sake! The one in the wheelchair! Look, I would like to have a talk with their last year's teacher! Who was it? Mr. Uh-heh, Garrison?! Why?! Where did he go?! But I need help reaching these kids! I have nothing but the hghest expectations for them. And with  God as my witness- I'm going to teach these kids the wonders of the world, so that they can reach the top!  I hope that sometime very soon you will let me in on what happened to this Mr. Garrison! And with that I will bid you good day! Alright, children, I hope you all did your homework last night. Please pass your papers up to the frontuh. I said, pass your papers to the fronteh! It's Choksondik! And you are all going to have detention! What are you doing?! Well, well, well! I'd say somebody has some explaining to do! Children! Children, come back here! I HAVE HAD IT!!! These children are out of control! I must speak with their last year's teacher, Mr. Garrison! What in God's name happened to him? And, nobody has found him? I see.  Then the only way I'll find the secret to teaching these kids is to go up into those mountains and find Mr. Garrison myself! Oh, I'll find him! Even if I have to climb up  and up  and up! What? Hello-oo-ooo.  Oh, what am I doing? I'm gonna get myself killed.  Is anyone here?  Mister? Mr. Garrison? I am the new fourth grade teacher. I've come to... seek your help.  Please. I don't know how to handle the new fourth graders. I've tried everything. I need to know how you taught them. Mr. Garrison, you knew how to reach these kids! You're my only hope! Choksondik. Mr. Garrison, these children are depeding on me to give them a future. I can't do it without your guidance. Please! Help me, for them! For the future of our children! ...Done. ""Children, we are now going to do math problems."" ""Uuh! Ah, you will do them or else you'll be in very big trouble!"" ""Don't use that kind of language, young man!"" No?? Oh. Pre-sent them? I'm ready. I'm not afraid. What lives inside? Oh, alrighty.  What the? Why there's nothng in here but an exit to the other side!  There's nothing in here at all. ...Oh, and I actually thought my mental demons would be in here.  Wait a minute. Maybe there's not supposed to be anythng in here. Maybe I'm supposed to see that I alone do have the strength to reach the kids!  I think I get it now! Alright, children, I hope you all did your-  Oowhat is going on now?! Oh Good Gravy, not this again. Children, I will have order!! Children, get back into your seats! Eric, I mean it! Present them. You said, ""suck my balls."" Well, go ahead. Whip 'em out, and I'll suck 'em. Now, children, listen to me. Why do you want to go back in time? Life isn't about going back, it's about going forward. Yes, there are times in our life that we wish we could relive, but, if we already lived them perfectly, why live them again? The adventure of life is that there's always something new. New challenges, new experiences. A fun game is a game that gets harder as it goes. So it is with life. Do you understand? Alright, students, that will be quite enough! If you're ready, let's continue on... with the fourth grade. Now, what we are going to dissect today is the West Indian manatee.  Manatees are mammals that live in the oceans and are often called the gentle clowns of the sea. They sure are, Wendy, and that's why we must learn what's inside them.  Now, we don't have quite enough  manatees to go around, so I think we're gonna have to split up into groups of four. Oh, hold on.  Now, children, our first incision will be along the abdomen. And now we will be removing the spleen. Notice how the manatee's spleen is designed for a qu- Alright, continue with the removal of the spleen, childen. I'll be right back. Oh dear. Alright, children, now, let's get back in our seats. Uh, we are now going to put the manatees back together. Well, I think people are just fed up with the crowded shopping and the credit-card bills, uh.  I, I think that the holiday just has become a joke. We got so caught up in the little things of Christmas, like love and family that... we almost fogot it's buying things that makes our economy thrive. Alright, children, in lieu of the common usage, I'm s'posed to clarify the school's position on the word, ""shit."" Yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form You can only use it in the non-literal sense. For instance,  ""That's a shitty picture of me."" is now fine. Hoever, the literal noun form of  ""This is a picture of shit."" is still naughty. The adjective form is now also acceptable. For example:  ""The weather outside is shitty."" However, the literal adjective is NOT appropriate. For example:  ""My bad diarrhea made the inside of the toilet bowl shitty, and I had to clean it with a rag, which then also became shitty.""  That's right out! Very good, Timmy. Yes, that's now fine. Boys, watch your language! Shit! Alright, children, let's settle down. As you know, this coming Friday is Earth Day.  and I'm pleased to announce that the national Earth Day organization has chosen South Park as its location for the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival. The heads of the Earth Day Brainwashing organization are here to tell you all about it. I'm sorry, boys, but nothing's more important than Earth Day. Naive at what cost, Chef? Parents, we have to face facts: Children in America are having sex at younger and younger ages. STDs are affecting younger and younger kids all the time. The only way we can combat that is by educating children before they have sex. Alright girls, even though this may be stuff you don't want to hear, you need to hear it. Fun! It's going to be fun! Well let's start with our first lesson, then, shall we?  SEXUALLY TRANSMITTTED DISEASES!! That's right, because unless you get boys to wear condoms you can and will get a sexually transmitted disease from them! How fun is that, hmmm?! Is that fun? Today over 20,000 Americans will contract a sexual disease! TODAY! Twelve thousand more tomorrow! And the reason is that you girls wake up in the morning and say, ""It's not going to happen to me."" You say, ""Oh, Ms. Choksondik, that happens to girls in Detroit, in Brooklyn, but not here in Colorado."" WRONG!  Gonorrhea, herpes, clamydia, HPV, HIV, syphillis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, the list goes on and on! These are serious diseases! They have serious consequences!  You think that sex is about fun and games and love?  Wrong! Sex is about disease! Here's a little picture of herpes. And here's a little syphillis for you! That's right, girls. Here's what happens when you don't get boys to use condoms! Oh, it's no problem, Mr. Mackey. It's probably best we come up with a lesson plan together anyway. Well we should make sure our students are good and scared of the consequences. We have to teach them that diseases are possible even with just oral sex. Using your mouth on the penis or vagina. It's just too bad these girls are having sex so young. Did I what? Well, if you must know, I'm still somewhat of a virgin.  But I'm not ashamed of it!  I wasn't sought after much in high school or college.  I was made fun of most of my life for having such large glasses.  The only boyfriend I ever had was this attractive popular boy named Steven Garrett. I liked him very much, but I... found out that he was dating me because he lost a bet on the Superbowl. The loser had to go out with me for three days. People can be very cruel. Anyway, I know it's hard to understand. Your nickname? ...Right. Wow, I've... never met a man who is... as sexually unappealing as me. Well, I'm quite happy without sex. I mehean, with all the diseases and problems out there, who needs it, right? Well, back to the lesson plan, then. Okay.  ""Oral Sex"" I knew it! Well, at least we scared them enough to protect themselves. But now maybe you'll believe me when I say that we need to be teaching even younger than fourth grade. ...Kindergarten. We've got to get to the students before they start having... sex. Nu-not after. Alright girls. Yesterday we went over the myriad of diseases you can get from boys, but today we're going to talk about the most horrible they can give you of all.  PREGNANCY!  That's right, since you girls have decided to be sexually active, teen pregnancy is at an all-time high! You seem to think it's gonna be fun and neat to have a baby-well, let's watch a little video, shall we?! Girls! Girls! Where are you going?! Did you feel something? I'm afraid this is all my fault. I... think I went a little overboard scaring the girls. I forgot to tell them that to get diseases from boys you... have to thave sex with them first. He's right. I never knew how special and personal sex was un... until just recently Alright class, as some of you may have heard, the President has asked that American children all send one dollar to the children of Afghanistan.  So I have a list of addresses and we're goin' to all chip in. Eric, the Afghan people need our help! Alright, children, we are all sending a dollar to the kids in Afghanistan! That's it! End of discussion! Next in line! Come on, let's keep it moving, kids! Kyle, we're taking pictures without hats today! Alright, class, I have your school photos to hand out- Most of them are very nice. But, apparently, one of you thinks it's fun to spoil their school pictures , and thinks he's a comedian. That person will be spending the afternoon in the principal's office! School photos aren't for joking around, so you aren't getting your photo back, Butters! For the rest of you, I think your pictures turned out very nicely. Eric, calm down. I'm trying to yell at Butters! You know very well my name isn't Chokesonrocks, it's Choksondik! Say it right or you can go to the principal's with Butters! Your mother is waiting for you in the principal's office. And I know you'll all be very nice to our new student.  Kyle, why don't you tell us a little about yourself? Okay, why don't you go ahead and take a seat, Kyle? Yes, unfortunately the school seems to be completely out of extra desks. So you'll just have to share with your cousin. Now let's get on with our lesson on the- I'm sorry, Kyle. You'll just have to make do.  Now let's get back to the le- Now Kyle, I need you to be quiet. In my class you need to be able to concentrate. Concentration is the key to succeeding in my class. Okay, good job, Butters. You get a check. Okay. Whose project should we look at next? How aboouuut Eric?  Eric Cartman? NOW Eric! You just put that thing together just now! I'm giving you a check minus. Siddown What did you say?! Alright, Token, you're next. Very very good, Token. You get a check plus. Eric, for the love of God. Alright, class, let's take our seats. Now, uh, before we get started, Stan and Kyle? Uh, the principal needs to see you in her office. She needs to see you now! Let's all say hello to Rancher Bob. Sit down, boys. All right, children, before we get started, has anybody seen the eraser for the chalkboard?  It probably got knocked on the floor somewhere. Can you all just please look around your desks for it? No? Oh, oh well. Never mind. I've got a backup one in the desk.  Okay, today children, we're gonna learn about multiplying times five. Now, whenever we multiply a number times five, the result is going to end in a zero or a five. What is it, Butters? Oh alright Butters. Take the bathroom pass and go.  Okay, so for instance, children- Just go, Butters.  Okay, so for instance, five times one is... what, Eric? Five... times...  one. Who are you? Hey! That kid took my last eraser! Come back here, kid! Butters, did you see another little kid run out of here? It looks fine, Butters.  Okay, hold on and stay here, children."
"BUTERS","Huh-it sure was."
"THE NERDS","Yup."
"SWAT HANSEN","Closer!  Don't worry, son. Just watch your speed and stay still!"

Alright, young man, when you get underneath that wheelchair, I want you to relay back to me with this walky-talky, and then I'll tell you which wires to cross. Ready? Go below! Stay calm!

"CLEAN GARRISON","I am you.  I am your gay side. You must face me at last. It is me, your darkest fear. Your gay self, incarnate. I want you to not fight me anymore. To accept me, once and for all. Don't you see?  All these years, your pain, your confusion, it comes from one place. Your denial of who you are. Of who... we are. Oh, stop it! What about the time you looked at Counselor Mackey's penis in the men's locker room?! For seven minutes?! And what about the time you masturbated to the men's 100-meter swimming relay at the Olympics?! THERE WERE NO CHICKS! ADMIT IT! YOU HAVE TO STOP LYING TO YOURSELF AND GET A G-"

"JEFFREY MAYNARD","I would swear it on my life. Your play shall want for nothing. Now, the first thing a good musical needs is a big opening number. Something that sets up the entire show. Wait! What's that, you say? A thanksgiving turkey is what you require? I know of a turkey. During my years on Broadway I... worked with a turkey who could do all kinds of tricks. She even jumped through a hoop of fire. I will go promptly and call her trainer. On the morrow you shall have your trick performing turkey."
"ACTORS","1800's, Alabama! What a great place and time! And in this little town in 1800's Alabama there's a family by the name of Keller!"

Well, you know in theater sometimes, we try different tricks to get the creative juices flowing. Let's see.  Helen Keller was blind and deaf.  Perhaps you should see what it is like. Deprive yourself of your senses and see what plays inside your mind. Here. Just relax. Just try to let your mind wander and let the juices flow... Well, did you see anything? ...Oh, that's too bad. I do. I know the part. If I must, I can go on. I cannot hear what they are saying. I cannot tell them how I feel. If only I could say things that go on in my mind. Wawa.

She's pooped all over the room! Kill the other turkey! Well, it could meet with ""an unfortunate accident."" It's very simple! Either that turkay meets with an unfortunate accident, or you don't have a feat-performing turkey for your Helen Keller Thanksgiving musical! Little boy. Yes, Tim. I feel I must speak with you. The others, well, they don't want you to know, but, oh, I don't know what to do. Should I tell you? I feel I'm the only one who can be honest with you.  The animal shelter is on its way to...take your turkeyy away from you. You see, they don't allow children in your... situation... to have wild animals as pets. You can't take him running, you can't take care of him. They... have to take it away. They take wild pets away from people like you... and hand them over for experiments. And they're shocked, dissected, and falyed while thery're still alive. And no matter where you go, the shelter people will find you. The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to... let him go. Back into the wild.  Oh no! Here they come now! Quick, go! And set your turkey free! I'll try to stall them.

"MRS. JOE","Pip, where 'ave you been?! What the hell's lovely about it?!  Joe, teach this boy some bloody cynicsim! A lot of bloody good a fire poker's gonna do while I'm starvin' to death! Why don't you make us some bloody food to eat! STOP your metal orange, you bastard! You never want a tablespoon of nigh'ingale droppin's, you me'al-poundin' fairy! And you! Why don't you ge' a job?! You're eight years old now! Shut up, you silly lip! What are we supposed to do with a metal newspaper? Where? ""Havesham residence seeks young boy to play with lonely daughter. Will pay up to..."" TWENTY QUID A DAY??"
"A BRITISH PERSON","Well, the very next day, Pip went to Old Ms. Havesham's house to inquire about the job.  and it was there that he met the girl of his dreams. That night, Pip spent all his sleeping hours unable to get Estella's beautiful face out of his mind. Day after day Pip visited Estella. Sometimes they would play, sometimes they would talk. But every single day Pip's love for Estella grew. Well, what a spot poor Pip was in. He was hired to be the friend of the very harsh and beautiful Estella. And although she treated him like dirt, or perhaps because she treated him like dirt, Pip found himself more in love with the little girl each and every day.  Oh, bless him! Isn't he lovely??  But, isn't it sad? Because Pip knew that someone as sophisticated and as wealthy as Estella could never love him, for he was just a simple blacksmith's apprentice. And so Pip spent the next several months learning how to be a gentleman. He was schooled in several languages. He was taught fencing and marksmanship, and he was shown how to dance and eat box. And after it all, after WEEKS and weeks of intense schooling, Pip was finally a full-fledged gentleman. Proud of himself, Pip decided to pay Ms. Havesham a visit, to thank her for her generosity, and to see if he was indeed, now, good enough for Estella. Yes. Our young Pip had come a long way. From the apprentice of a blacksmith to a fine young gentleman of great expectations. And now he was to finally see his beloved Estella again at a Grand Ball held by the King of England, Tony Blair. It was here that Pip would finally and formally ask Estella to be his girlfriend. And all would be right with the world. And now we come to the final act of the Dickens classic tale, inwhich the stage is set for an epic showdown. Ms. Havesham's robot monkeys prove a formidable foe, but Pip is not about to let Estella's soul be forever consumed by the Genesis device. And now the thrilling conclusion of Great Expectations!"
"MS. HAVESHAM","Who is that? Come closer. Look at me.  Does it frighten you to look upon a woman who has not seen the sun in over 20 years? I sometimes have sick fancies.  And I have a fancy I should like to see someone play. So, play. Play. Estella, play with this boy. But, you can break his heart. What do you think of her? Hm-m-m. What else? Hm, you quite fancy her, don't you? Come back again next week. We shall ""play"" some more. Yes, good. She will break his pathetic heart into a million pieces. Come closer, Pip.  My, you're quite the gentleman now, aren't you? Perhaps. Estella's been off to school as well.  She's become quite the lady. Would you like to see a picture of her? Ohoh, you love her, don't you, Pip? Do you know what love is, Pip? It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to snip it. Love her, Pip. I developed her into what she is so that she might... be loved. There's a dance at the Palace tomorrow night. Estella will be there. Go and seek her out. And love her. Love her! And if she warms to you, love her; she tears your heart into pieces. And as you get older it will tear deeper. Lover her. Well well well, if it isn't Mr. Pip. Don't they make a handsome couple, Pip? Look at the way he holds her hand. Things aren't always as they seem, Pip. Oh, what's the matter? Did she... break your heart? Yes. Tell me about the pain.  Tell me about the crushing and the prickly things. Yes, and it is somewhat difficult to breathe. Is your heart broken as well? Tell me all about it. Wuh-hy? Well, that's simple. Because I need the tears of broken-hearted men to use in my Genesis device.  You see, my foolish child, I'm growing very old. But tonight I will fuse my soul into Estella's once and for all. And then I can go on breaking men's hearts for another generation. Estella, prepare yourself for the Genesis platform. And as for you, Pip, my robot monkeys should take care of you! Are you ready, Estella? Are you ready to complete the cycle? Quite the contrary, blacksmith. My revenge on the male race is only about to begin. Yes. Cry away, males.  Once your tears have collected into the Genesis device, the fusion of Estella and me will be complete. Won't I?  Let the transformation begin. It begins. ...Yes... Yessss!  Noooo!"
"ESTELLA","With HIM?  But he's just a commoner! ...Alright, boy, let us play. We're going to play a little game called, ""Smack the Blond Boy In the Head With a Large Log."" Oh, you stupid pathetic boy! Boy, do you still think I'm pretty? And, do you still think I'm insulting? I hate you! You're an oozing, painful hemorrhoid that belches pus! You may kiss me if you like.  Come. Let us walk in the daisy garden. Just another playmate hired to amuse me. You didn't think you were the only one, did you? Oh, you silly small-testicled boy. Come, let us walk through the rose garden. Pip.  My goodness, how you've changed! I suppose.  So how is it that you've learned to dress and dance? Iiii see, and you no longer live with the blacksmith? Naturally. Is it? Why? Pip, you must know that I have no heart. Oh, I have a heart to be shot or stabbed in, no doubt, and if it cease to beat I should cease to be, but  you know what I mean. I have no softness there, no sympathy, sentiment. Alright, Steve. Just one moment. That is Steve. He is seventeen and has a car. I should. He's my boyfriend. What's the matter, Pip?! It's... it's... the way it goes sometimes, Pip.  He's... seventeen and has a car. I'm... I'm... very  I'm  leaving. Yes, Mother. Pip? It is... what I was raised for. I told you, Pip. I have no heart Oh my. 'E's very cute. I don't want to. I don't see the point in this. I don't want to kill any more of them. You think so? Let me see it  Maybe I can kill it. Yes. her poor miserable life is finally over. Yes! Yes, my small-testicled love!"
"DREAM ESTELLA","Stop dreaming about me, you slow-witted rectal belch!"
"LAWYER","Joe, the blacksmith? I'm a lawyer from London in search of a young lad named Pip. Mr. Blacksmith, I've been sent here to offer you a reasonable sum of money in exchange for your apprentice. I have a client who wishes to give this bright child a future. Anything he desires. Do you still object? He will one day inherit a handsome property. But the owner of that property wants him first to travel to London and learn to be a gentleman. There's only one condition, Pip. Your benefactor wishes to remain anonymous OH OH! If you have any suspicion of who that person might be, you are to keep it in your own breast. Understood? Then you will go to London in a week's time.  Here's 20 sterling. Well, blacksmith, you look stunned. Then I should take my leave.  Good evening, gentlemen, and we shall see you in London next week, Pip. You shall stay here with your roommate, Mr. Pocket. He is a distinguished young lad who will help you on your way to being a gentleman. I trust you see no problem with this? I should think not.  On up, then, and prepare for school on the morrow. Boys I want to thank you for coming down to my office on such short notice. No. Boys, I'm a laywer. Your friend Kenny has passed away and I've called you here to read his will. In the highly liekly event of my death, I, Kenny McCormick, wish to leave all my belongings to my good friends, Stan and Kyle. Dudes, you were the friends a guy could have. To Eric Cartman: Eric, I never really liked you. But then, nobody does. You have no ability to feel, and you are going to die alone and miserable. It is only because I feel so sorry for you that I leave you my Sony PSP. There is one more thing I would like to ask you all, as my friends. If I should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on life-support, please,... I don't know. I lost the last page. It's right here, along with Kenny's other belongings. They're all yours."
"POCKET","Pray, come in! As do you. Perhaps we've seen each other before. As to our lodging, it's not by any means splendid. This is our sitting room - just chairs and tables and carpet and so forth.  This is my little room - rather musty, and this is your bedroom. Oh, what a gay time we shall have, and I do mean gay as in festive, not as in penetration of the bum. Oh, but dear me! I beg your pardon! You're holding your bags all this time! Pray, let me take them!  I'm quite ashamed! Why, yes of course! You're the prowling little boy! Boy, what a smashing coincidence! That old biddy? Oh, I assure you, I have nothing to do with her anymore. She's absolutely mad! Well, don't you know about Ms. Havesham's melancholy past? Dear me, it's quite a story, and should be discussed over dinner. Come!  Right, time for a smashing meal and the story of Ms. Havesham. You'll do fine, dear fellow, just fine. Now on to Ms. Havesham: She was raised by a wealthy father and grew up to be a somewhat of a spoiled brat.  And now I might mention, Pip, that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth. Not at all, I'm sure.  Anyway, Ms. Havesham grew up to be a lovely young lady, and soon a man came along, which gets me to the cruel part of the story, merely breaking off, Pip , to remark that a dinner napkin should never be placed into the tumbler. Not at all, I'm sure.  So this man pursued Ms. Havesham closely and professed to be devoted to her. She passionately loved him back. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dress was bought, the wedding guests were all invited, and finally the day came. But not the groom.  And I break from the tale now only to mention that one should never pass gas at the dinner table! Not at all, I'm sure. So the groom never showed. He simply wrote a letter, a letter that Ms. Havesham received 20 minutes before the wedding. But afterward she laid waste to the entire house, as you have seen it, and has never since looked upon the light of day. And the story ends, Pip, with me suggesting that one should never pull out the wee wee and check it for scabs whilst at the table. Not at all, I'm sure! Joe found you lying face down in the street, Mr. Pip, You were in such a state. You've been unconscious here for nearly three hours. I tried to tell you, Pip. She's a vengeful, spiteful woman.who wanted nothing more than to see you hurt along with the rest of the male sex. Righto. Pip. Righto. Dear God, Pip, look! Righto, Pip. Hello, gentlemen. Oh, whatever you do, please do not cry. Havesham's device fuels itself on your tears, I'm afraid. Yes, but just thnk about... panda bears! Oh, they're so cuddly and sweet, panda bears are.  What silly little noses they have! Oh, right, right, let's not think about panda bears, then. Let's think about ...swimming! Oh, what jolly fun swimming is, with a splishy-splash and a hold-your-breath dive. Oh what fun it is to collect stamps! Lick the backs, put them into books all neat and tidy with those smashing little pictures and bright colors. Right, let's not talk about stamp-collecting, then. Let's talk about... Oh what fun ice-skating is!  Who can catch me? Who can catch the ice-skating king? That's me. Please, sirs, you must not cry! Philip, it's too late!! Ooooo, top smart, Pip!"

Estella, help me! I'm your boyfriend! Wha? But Token's never seen a porno before. He wouldn't know what to- Oh God! Token?  Alright, Token. We know you must be very confused about what you saw. Jesus, what kind of porno is that?? Oh, Jesus, not that one! Oh yeah, the Prime Minister, eh? He sure has screwed up things for Newfoundland. Life just hasn't been the same since he made sodomy illegal. Yeah, sure, except there's just one problem. You folks are goin' the wrong way. Yeah. And you all went the wrong direction on it. Of course, we could always take my boat, eh? Okay, next stop, the new Prime Minister. Here we are at the Parliament buildin'. Yeah, we gave it our best, but our best wasn't good enough, eh? And we can't perform sodomy, eh? And I can sodomize me boys again"

In fact, I'd say I'm  a little bit trimmer than you, fatboy!  Heh heh. Just kidding, Kyle. No. Actually, I found a diet that totally works. God-damnit, all I got was a little golf clap! This is ridiculous! Lunchtime! I'm starved! That's me. Oh, there you are. Alright, I got the goods. Some candy bars, a few donuts, and some beef gravy. Nobody. Your mom even thinks I'm a skinny you. Uh uh. One thing. I want a bigger cut. I'm the one risking my ass, running around in that stupid town pretending to be you and collecting all the food to bring up here! All you have to do is sit back and sell it to all the fat kids! Twenty. Fine! Then I shall bid you good day! This is so juvenile. Eh, nothing. Hey, can I have some of that licorice to- take home? You know, maybe we've all learned something here. I mean, we set Kenny up to further and further himself each time, havin' to always outdo himself. Now he's in jail for being a whore. And perhaps, just perhaps, we are to blame. Uh oh."
"JAMES TAYLOR"," JAMES TAYLOR"
"OTHER STUDENTS","Whoa!"
"CHAD","'Cause I'm always gonna be fat. I don't wanna eat no sweets, but I can't control myself when they're right in front of me like this.  All my life I've been fat. I've beh- I've been to seven camps and I swore to my momma that I'd lose the weight. I want to, but I can't help myself. I'd, I do? Wait a second! This isn't right!  It's time for me to be responsible for my own actions! Mom, Dad, we've been eating candy this whole time! Eric Cartman's been sneaking in junk food!"
"HOWARD STERN","Alright, so we're back talkin' to three competing celebrities: Tom Green, Johnny Knoxville from MTV's Jackass and Krazy Kenny. Krazy Kenny is here to promote his Pay-Per-View special this week, where he will crawl up into a bus driver's uterus and stay there for six hous. Now, some people that all you guys do is perform sick and disgusting acts for shock value and money, which makes you whores. But I'd like to prove them wrong. So what I'm gonna do... is I'm gonna offer each of you $50,000 to give me oral sex right now. Oh. Ooh, the kid says he'll do it for ten bucks. Alright, let's get going, then. Can we cut the cameras?"
"TOM GREEN","Hey, Howard. I'm in. Fine! I'll do it for 40! 20! Damnit. I'm out."
"JOHNNY KNOXVILLE","Wow! Me too. 30. Me too. I guess he is the biggest whore."
"CAMPERS","Woo-aagh. Woo-ugh. Woo-aagh. Woo-ugh. Yeah."
"MR. SANDERS","No! I have had it! Look at what you've done to my boy! You told Horace that he was responsible for his weight! You made him believe that with exercise and proper diet, he could be thin! When we told you it was his genetics! Look at these kids! They're not getting any thinner!  Your camp is a fraud! You need to accept the fact that most fat people are just genetically fat! Your time is up! And I'm going to call all the other parents to tell them to come claim their kids as well! Your camp is a WASTE ...of time! What?! Well, what the heck. Maybe when you're all donen you can teaach me a thing or two, huh son?"
"MRS. SANDERS","Yeah, your time is up!"
"HORACE","But, Dad, I... ...Nothin'. No, he's right. The counselors've been doing a good job. We've just been cheating. I believe I can lose the weight with exercise and proper diet. I don't wanna make excuses no more. If you take us back, we promise we won't cheat."
"NEW KENNY","No way! I'm not doing this! But this isn't fair! (But I'm gonna starve to death if I get in there)"

What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?! Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright? Mark, are we doing the right thing?

Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone? But what about before that? Yes!! Mark, I'm scared. Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place. Oh no. NO!  Aaaah!

He must be parkiing someone else's car. Excuse me, where can where would we find young men's fashion apparel? What, what brand are they? Stay away from me, bastard! You don't know anything! Then why, Chris, why??!! Well,  you don't have to worry about your family being in your way anymore! There is no going back, Chris! No!  Our son is dead! I killed him.  I was going to end it all, and everything spun out of control for me. I drowned Butters iin the car, Chris! I WASN'T THINKING!  I couldn't think! You destroyed my life, you!!  D'Oh, God, what have I done?! Oh, Butter-her-hers-ss-ss- Just go away and let me die! I'm a murderer, Chris! I don't have a life now! No, no, not yet. But if you're out there, we beg you: we just want our baby returned safely back to us. Puerto Rican. He was... average Puerto Rican height. Please, just bring our baby back to me. Yes, I... remember hearing something about that. Thank goodness. Oh. Sure. I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story! Don't forget: your lies started all this. Butters?? Oh, Butters! Oh, my baby's back! Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home. Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?! You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT! You sure are. No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world.  And I am so happy you're alive. We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean. And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im. We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again. Butters? BUTTERS?? This is unbelievable! How many times have we told you not to have self-performed liposuction surgery in our house?! Butters, your father called and said you made him very upset! Butters, where did you get that kind of smart mouth?! Oh, you just weit till I get home, mister!! Oh, we're just really happy that your boys have become such good friends with our little Butters. Freinds, by default. Oh, Chris.  Hey look, this lift goes right into a building. No! Nooo! Just what did you think you were doing, Butters? Not only did you lie to us and say you were on a camping trip with Kyle's family, you made a fool of yourself AND us on national television! Your father and I have to leave now to visit Grandma in the hospital, but you can just take those balls off your chin and march right up to your room! Butters, time for bed. Good morning, Butters. No,  I didn't hear about that. Butters, a note for you was left on the front door. Here you go.  And wash your hands after you touch those hamster - you'll get AIDS Butters! Don't forget: dinner is in two hours! Now Daddy and I have to do our taxes, so you can watch this by yourself and not get scared? No, just Butters. He's been watching the Lord of the Rings downstairs. Ohh Godd!! Butters?  Butters! Is that bad? Yes, and I really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate America. Was it me, or did you all think that Nancy Drew solved the riddle of Elephant Mountain a little too easily? Oh, hello boys. Future Butters, it's time to take your liver medicine. Oh my God, our house! Wait a minute. Chris, don't you see? This might be our fault. We just so desperately wanted you to never try drugs that we used a big scare tactic instead of ...telling you the truth. We're sorry, baby. What fibs have you been telling this policeman, Butters?! You know damn well you didn't toilet-paper that house! Butters, what have we told you about confessing to crimes you didn't commit?! We have had it, mister! Haven't you seen Quuer Eye For the Straight Guy, Sheila? These five gay men go around and show straight men how to better themselves. It's the best. And they like to talk about their feeling now and drink wine and decorate the house. I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look. What? I should have never wished for a cleaner, neater husband. You turned our husbands into whiny little wusses!! That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to. Oh Butters! What are you spending all that money on, Butters? You... have a girlfriend, Butters? Oh, that is so cute. When do we get to meet her? All right, you win. Stephen, what is this place? This place is horrible. To objectify girls like this. Little girl, you shouldn't be working here. No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere where you're paid for how you look. You should be learning a skill so you can grow up to be a businesswoman or even a doctor. Who knows? You could cure cancer. ... Oh. Never mind, I think Raisins might be the perfect place for you. Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips. Hi Butters. Oooh, Butters, are you going out to play again? Well, could you be a sweetie and take that pie over there to the Thomsons. I made it to thank them for babysitting you last week. Butters! Butters, you have some visitors. Butters?  Butters?? Oh. Oh dear. I'm sorry kids, it's just that... Butters hasn't danced since the tragedy. I'm sorry, kids, you'll have to go. Butters? Butters? Come on, sweetie, it's gonna be okay.  Come on, Butters. You went through a lot of therapy for this. That was almost two years ago, sweetie. Ohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot. Ah, Buttters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon. Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night? That's okay with your mom, Mr. Robot? Aww, that's just adorable. Yes, it has just been a delight having your son over, Mrs. Cartman. He and Butters are really getting along great. Well, the reason I'm calling is that Butters is supposed to go see his Aunt Nellie in Los Angeles this weekend. The boys are getting along so well that we were thinking of inviting Eric to go along. Excuse me, I didn't catch that. Oh, wonderful! The boys will be so excited. Hey guys, great news! It's been arranged: you two are both going to Los Angeles to visit Butters' Aunt Nellie! You've been shut up in your room for days, Butters. You need to go outside, go play. Why not? What on earth is the matter with him? I just can't stand to hear him scream like that. I'm gonna go upstairs. Thanks so much for coming to visit Butters in the hospital, boys. It means a lot to him. What's that? If only we had let him in!  Why didn't we let him inside the house when he was screaming for help?? Butters? You're dating Paris Hilton? You are grounded, mister! Chris, she's more than twice Butters' age! Uhm, Paris, would you like to have some cocoa with us? With you where? How much? For Butters? Chris, is she serious? We aren't honestly considering this? But he's our son! The rest of the f- you do mean us? Bye, sweetie, we love you! A what? Steven, what do we do? I'm your engineer. I have to do it, Steven. Butters, if anything happens to Mommy, I, I want you to be a good boy. Online It's useless. The main power line has been shut down. We made it, We made it! We don't have time to argue! They're gonna nuke us! What? Butters, what on earth are you doing?? Dead people? Oh, Stephen, I don't know if we should ground him or call a doctor. What do you think, Doctor? Oh no.  NO! Goodnight, baby."

Yeah So I'm the leg of a leopard and the wings of a hen But Dad, we can fix the projector. Dad, you taught me an important lesson: That crap is the cycle of everything. No, it wasn't a stupid song. Because you showed me that I have the power and the strength to do anything I want. You made me believe in myself, Dad! Now I'm asking you to do the same."

Come! There is much to discuss.  Things are not good in Heaven, Kenny. Satan is planning a massiva attack and he knows we are too few in number to stop him! God has changed the rules here. For ages, only Mormons were allowed into Heaven.  But knowing that Hell was becoming much larger, God decided to let more people cross over so that he could build an army as well, an army that YOU must command. The Sony PSP was built by God, to determine who on Earth had the best skills to defeat the armies of Satan. You... are the best. YOU, are the only hope for the universe. He beat Satan's army in over three thousand separate simulations. Satan's army has crossed over the Plains of Limbo!"

Come, we must see the sorcerer! There Americans wish to see the Skyre! How could you foolish Americans bring the wrath of scorn by mass-chanting the word of wretchedness?! Didn't you realize ""shit"" is a curse word?! Ha! Leave it to American to think that ""no"" means yes, ""pissed"" means angry, and ""curse word"" means something other than a word that's cursed!! Saying a word of curse once in a while does nothing. It's only when spoken repeatedly and en masse that the curse takes place."

"SORCERER","Let me see the stone. Uhuh-I've seen this before. Stones that were used by the Knights of Standards and Practices. A legion of men sworn to do whatever necessary to keep the words at bay. But... they were just a myth. The knights were formed to keep curse words to a minimum. Should a curse word ever be let out, they would return. A rune for each word of curse was made, representing each of the eight words that so offended God... Look at this: The writing here claims this stone can defeat the evil geldon , who will rise when the word of curse has been said enough times to give him power. Then all the world will be destroyed. What? Then we haven't much time. We must go!"
"BLOND KNIGHT","Turn off those devices of broadcast! We are the Royal Order of Standards and Practices! See that you do!"

Now, fall in and strip down, Scouts! Alright, Scouts, we're gonna end this meeting with a little puppet show. Here's a little Scout. He's always prepared. He's always ready.

"GLORIA ALLRED","It is a disgrace that these homophobes are allowed to discriminate.  I am taking this case on, personally! Today is a great day for democracy. The Scouts have been exposed for the vile gay bashers they are.  And we all it all to me, and these six brave little boys  five... brave little boys. And now, here to take his official oath back in Scouts is Big Gay Al. You can't do this! You homophobe!"
"CHIEF JUSTICE","In the case of Big Gay Al versus Mountain Scouts of America: due to the overwhelming show of support, it is the ruling of this court that the Scouts must allow Big Gay Al and all gays into their club! And furthermore, the Scout elders will be put into stocks for three days, so they can see how it feels to be outcast! Well I'm sorry, young man, but the parents want their child kept alive. I don't believe you have any legal authority here. Kenny's BFF says that Kenny didn't want to be kept alive artificially. The courts have determined we must obey his wish. That's all the verification we need. Pull the feeding tube, doctor."

Mr. Kern, I want you to just... think about a card. Pick any card, and picture it in your mind. Okay, jus... s think about your card. okay, look at me.  Look at me... Look at me... okay, now reach up your ass. Go on, reach up your ass. Deeper. Was that the card you picked? Thank you. I've been traveling from town to town for quite a while. I've started quite a following, mostly because of my levitation tricktwah. Watch. Watch. Hello, my children. Thank you, everyone.  Our organization grows larger every day. Soon, the government will even have to give us tax-exempt status as a bona fide religion. Your magic is old and outdated, Jesus! twah. Just like you are. The old religions have failed you! twah. What have they offered except for war, poverty, and sadness? Blainetology offers you the key to living your life to the fullest! Will you join us? You must understand, brother Kyle, twah, you know too much about the Church. If you left now, you'd become a danger to our cause. The suicide pact will go as planned. If we die, we all die together. If the government will not give us tax-exempt status, then we must prove that we are willing to die for our beliefs, twah. Give us what we want or we will continue to die Jesus! Not again. I don't think so. Get them! Perhaps you need to see some real magic. So long, Super Best Fools! Damn you, Super Best Friends! Then I guess you win this time, Super Best Fools! But I'll be back!"
"CAROL","No, I'm sorry. I picked the four of hearts. Daa-ah! Butters can't come out and play, boys. He thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that I have to pay for!

"BLAINETOLOGIST","Pamphlet. Pamphlet. Here you go, kids, take a pamphlet. Sweet Salvation! Don't leave us, David Blaine! He's right. He... he's right!"
"STEVEN","Oh yes, you see, David Blaine is much more than a magician. He's a scholar, a visionary, a leader. Oh, I've got a trick for you to learn: I can show you how to make your true self appear. Let me ask you all something: Do you consider yourselves to be happy? ...Right, yeh. Eh, see, the reason that you are unha- Wait, the.. the point is... that you can be happy. You see, your friends and parents have programmed you in a way that makes you feel isolated and alone. How many times have you felt like nobody knows the real... you? You're not really happy. Your potential hasn't even been reached. If you look through David Blaine's incredible book, you'll find a lot of life's answers. Let's read some of the book together, shall we? That's right. Congratulations, young Blainetologists. From this day, you are clean.  Now, we have very important work to do! David Blaine is going to put on a big magic show in Denver tonorrow night, where he's going to eat his own head. So it's up to all you new Blainetologists to get as many people there as you can. Whoever gets the most people to come gets a prize! Everyone! Everyone, gather 'round! I have great news for all Blainetologists, and for our new members as well. We've just gotten word from Mr. Blaine himself: The government has denied our church's request for tax-exempt status! Be-cause! Mr. Blaine has arranged for all Blainetologists members from every city and state to march into Washington and demand our right for tax-exepmt status by committing a mass suicide! Mr. Blaine has said that by killing ourselves in Washington, we are guaranteed everylasting happiness in the afterlife! Get your thngs ready. We leave for Washington at dawn! Alright, brothers and sisters, gather around.  It's time to drown ourselves in the Reflecting Pool!  However, the-ah Reflecting Pool is a little more shallow than we originally thought, so to drown ourselves, you will need to lie on your stomach, face down, until you die, as such. Our leader, he... he's leaving us! What is it, Martha? Our ssson! We realize that. But we just thought that maybe someone else had found Tommy, and then lost him again. We're pretty certain that it's our boy, considering his physical appearance. Martha and I have the... same condition. You may not have realized this, but we actually have buttocks where our heads should be. Yes. Over eleven people worldwide suffer from TPS Martha and I were lucky enough to meet each other at a TPS convention in France. No no, don't be silly. You see, with TPS, the birth defect is on the exterior only. Behind this we still have all our vital head organs - tongue, eyes, nasal passages... Uh, Thompssson. Now, Martha, what did I say about getting our hopesss up? We understand you've seen our son. They said to inquire four houses down. It was just such a coincidence, considering the photo. You may not have realized this, but Martha and I have buttocks where our heads should be. Tommy disappeared when he was only seven. Yes. He was in the care of our nanny at the time. Yes, but we last heard the nanny was heading west.  That's why we thought Colorado made sssssense. This certainly is a friendly town. You've all been sssssso wonderful. Please, please. It's not your fault. Delicious. Martha and I actually have buttocks where our heads should be. Well, it was 1982. Tommy was only six at the time. Yes, but since he appeared to be at least eight in the photo,  we assumed someone had seen him since we did. We don't really like chili; it makes us throw up. Son! Oh, our same ol' Ben! Aw, son. Damnit! Damnit!  Thanks a lot, kid! Yuh... actually suggesting that somebody drives right into the heart of that mob?? It's a suicide mission! Honey, no! I I can't believe we're actually listening to this. This is a crazy plan! Jesus... they're dead in the water. Goddamnit no! Y-you have to give them more time! Yeah, we did it, boys! We did it! We're going to the finals! Woohoo! Well we won! That means we've got the best record in the division! You're out. Yeah, well, you'd better watch yourself in the playoffs. I mean, you always get in a fight with scrappy redneck dats up here in the mountains, but some of those Division Two dads are tough! Can you believe it, boys?! We're playing in the State Championship Game! Well, then your whole season starts over, but on the national circuit! You get to spend your whole summer playing baseball! Then we'll spend the whole summer going to Nebraska, and to Iowa, and Wyoming. Keep running, kid!"

"MOHAMMED","Jesus, we've been working hard since we got your distress call! More than friends, young boy, we are super best friends, with the desire to fight for justice. Jesus, come look at this.  After your distress call, we entered David Blaine in the super best friends' computer. Moses, scan this tape. Can you tell us the source of Blaine's power? Mohammed! It is too powerful, Jesus! Krishna, we're going to need wood for a mold! I will find sources to concrete.  You, get the water to mix it with, Seaman."
"LOA TSE","Who the kid?"
"JOSEPH SMITH","We all believe in the power of good over evil. Except for Buddha, of course, who doesn't believe in evil. Look at that, Jesus. His followers are growing at a rate even faster than mine! It appears this David Blaine is as dangerous as you and your young friend had feared. Perhaps we should have Moses look at the tape and see what he comes up with. Omigod! If he gets tax-exempt status, then he'll become a real religion. Joseph Smith! My ice breath should take care of you. Now it's your turn, Blaine!"

And so, we think we can convince you to buy one of our combos that's opening right here in Phase 4. Oh, I know, that's what everybody says - ""Not me, I can't afford it."" But what if I told you you could own one of our properties for only eight thousand dollars? Well you see, ""time-share"" means you buy the condo with about twenty other people like yourselves  You  ""share"" the condo with other investors and pick the  ""time"" you want to stay. Sure it is, one twenty-fourth and a half yours! You see, time-share has made it possible for even working-class people like you to say, ""I've got a little place in Aspen."" Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Say guys, how'd you like to tell that hot secretary ""I've got a nice little place in Aspen""? Hahaha. Just kidding, wives. Woll uh, you still gotta come to the time-share luncheon. We did give you a free condo for the weekend. R-right, but this isn't that meeting. The luncheon is that meeting.  Don't worry, you're gonna have a great free meal at the luncheon. And THAT is why owning a piece of an Aspen condo is not only possible,... Op, here it is! As promised, a fabulous free lunch! You see? That's the great thing about time-share. You get a little taste of luxuries you can't afford. Of course you can. Go hit those slopes! If you could just please show me the backs of your table place cards real quick?  Oh my God! You got the red sticker! They got the red sticker! Okay, okay, fine, I mean...  It would only take a second, but, I mean, you know, what did we do for you except, give you a free condo for the weekend. Huh. Seems like you coud just... could just come up... and see what prize you had... Welcome back, folks ...And so you see it's the investment opportunity that keeps on giving. Heh-ey, you can leave anytime you want. Of course, that is, if you don't want the super-secret fun prize for attending the slide show. That's only a couple thousand each, Josh! Folks, I'm glad you're back, because we forgot to mention, time-share condos are still deeded properties! Oooo, you folks REALLY lucked out this time. You're visitor number one thousand! That's right! The police, the mayor, the president of the United States. Perhaps now you see the severity of your situation. I think we shall all sit down...  and listen to the presentation. Now, you're probably asking yourselves... ""Can my time-share condo turn into a profit?"" The answer might astonish you. For over ten years investors have seen their-"

The truth is, the park is a financial flop. I haven't turned a profit in years because I can't keep attendance up. You... you're not? Nn-oh. Well then, I guess I don't feel bad. My God, look at it, Chris! That kid completely turned this place around! Oh, if I could only have a park that worked like this! Oh, hello. Congratulations on your success.

This place is huge. You'll never notice two people. And then you'll have security for your park. I will shoot on sight. What? Uh, I'm security, not maintenance. Well your rides are gonna break down every now and then. You need to hire a maintenance person. Move along, sir. Move along, sir! You are vandalizing private property! Uh I don't know nothin'. Daaah, sorry, but ever since that IT thing came out the airlines have had to cut back on employees.

Okay... You sure? Don't forget to bring a towel. Be sure to bring a towel so you don't get aaall wet. . Where are we goin'? Are we gonna get high? Well, I'm gonna get a little high. If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel. What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away. I think so. I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important. Is! Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road. M-maybe it's down that dirt road. I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high.  then I'll remember where it is. Where's what? Well calm down. That's my last joint, asshole! Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit. Yeah, I think so.  Oh man. I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on. That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel. Let's see.  No. Hey it's been a long time! Don't preach to me, fatso! You're stupid! You're a towel!  Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high. Hold on.  Wait a second  That's it! Yeah.

"COMMANDER","Hello, boys, how are you? Say, boys, this may sound a little ...odd, but... have you see a ...talking ...towel around anywhere. Echo, this is Garrett. I've got a code 5 at...  Park County, Colorado! Repeat! Code 5, Park County Colorado! Well? Damnit! I knew those boys were protecting that towel.  They must have some unexplainable bond with it. It could already be anywhere, hiding out again. No, the time for being nice is over. We must instigate... Plan B. Yes.  Destroy all towels within a thousand mile radius. Ah yes.  Tell me, Marine, did you accomplish your primary goal? Ahh. And you're... quite sure of this. Hmm...  So perhaps, then, you can explain to me why we just got footage of the towel returning to Tynacorp?! Well I'm through playing hide and seek! We've got no other choice! Prepare to blow up all of Colorado! Well well well. Look what the cat dragged in. Genetic copies we tried to make with your TNA. They didn't work too well, I'm afraid. You did very well to get the towel this far, boys. I wonder: What did they tell you at Tynacorp? That the big, bad government wanted to genetically engineer a Towelie as a weapon? Now let me tell you the real story. Yes, we've been trying to make our own genetic copies of the towel, but only because we had to. You see, when we started spying on Tynacorp, we discovered a certain, terrifying secret. That Tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world! Don't you see what genetically enhanced smart towels like these are capable of? You get out of the shower and dry yourself off. But even after you're dry, the towel makes you more dry. It keeps getting you drier and drier. Can you imagine it? What it would feel like to be way, way too dry? I'll tell you something: You don't want to know. And I don't know. You've been double-crossed by Tynacorp, kids. They set this all up to get you in here and take us down. Oh yes. It has been all along. No, wait.  Perhaps now, we can use their own towel against them. These boys must return to Tynacorp, and we will launch a sneak attack on Tynacorp as well. You boys can take the towel to Tynacorp's central core, and upload this encryption disk into their system, bringing them down once and for all. Alright, boys, take the towel back in there and say your mission was accomplished. Then upload this encryption disk into their computers. If anything goes wrong, use this newly-developed photon rifle. Aaaaarrrr. Move move move move move move!  Don't make a move, you bastards! Don't listen to them. They lied to you before. Alright, maybe we lied to you, but it was to protect your own skin! We are a resistance group pretending to be the military to bring Tynacorp down! But perhaps we should show these kids who Tynacorp really is made up of. Go on! Tell them why you've been making towels! Zytar! And now you know the horrible truth, boys. Boys, try to reach the core override! We've got no choice but to try to take them all out!  I think I can get it from here, boys! Sorry, Zytar. Didn't yoru mom ever tell you? Don't mess with earthlings."

"RESEARCH LEADER","Welcome home, Smart Towel RG-400. Thank you for bringing him to us, boys. You see, this is not an ordinary towel. He is the RG-400 Smart Towel, designed with a computer chip inside the terry cloth You see, here at Tynacorp, our goal was to make the perfect towel. A towel that would sense how wet or dry the user's skin was and fluff itself accordingly. Towelie was our greatest success. Smart enough to beat the average human at chess and absorbent enough to soak up even the toughest spills. But then one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. Ah yes, your video game. I'm afraid that what we all experienced was a trap. They called you and said to bring the towel, and then they called us and said they were bringing Towelie back. Their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop. Why, the military. You see, after Towelie got high and wandered off from here, the military got a hold of him. They wanted to turn Towelie into a weapon of mass destruction. Towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his TNA. But then, one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. Again. I'm afraid not. Because your Okama GameSphere is at ""their"" base. You mean to go right into their base? Of course. The entry code should still be in Towelie's memory banks. You could sneak him in there and recover his TNA. Great plan. In a moment we will be over the base. This is the only way in. Any attempts on the ground would be easily spotted by guard posts. I hate to send you back in there, Towelie, but only you have their security system in your memory banks. Good luck, boys. The fate of the world is depending on you. The towel has a will of its own. It's... learning compassion. Then we have no choice. We'll have to test the new prototype a little... earlier. So, you thought you could outsmart us, did you kids? Bring the towel here, boys. They can't shoot children. Oh yes, boys. Obey your government! Well perhaps it's time these boys knew what was really gong on! You see boys, I'm afraid you were double-crossed. If they were the military, why wouldn't they just attack us to begin with? Because they're not the military!"

The Taliban has just released this videotape , in which it is clearly visible that they have indeed captured  Steivie Nicks. Miss Nicks appears to be in good spirits, though her whereabouts are unknown. With Stevie Nicks in captivity, the other members of Fleetwood Mac have been hidden so the Taliban can't get to them as well. :	The Taliban's video also shows what appears to be four American children in captivity, though they could just be French. The nation is rallying behind three sweet boys in Colorado who are building a ladder to heaven to be with their dead friend.  It's making Americans start to believe in heaven, again. Ha do YOU actually believe in the ladder to heaven? Uh, meanwhile, the American economy cont-  wait. Wait. Wait a minute.

The nanny that we trusted so much took off with him and we still don't know why.  We think perhaps she wanted a child of her own. We've tried every avenue to find him, but, we've never tried the milk company. Thank you. Thank you so much for helping us. Yes, I'm so grateful I just wanna cry again. Amazing. Oh, excuse me.

It's gonna take quite a while for the computer to do a scan of all missing kids. Hah, let's see. The Dallas-Ft. Wroth area. I haven't tried there yet. Computer? Scan for any children reported found in the Dallas-Ft. Wroth area, with a facial deformity. Ugh. This is hopeless! ...Wait a minute, let's try it this way: Computer? Scan databanks for children who reported their parents missing. Alright, then break it down to claims in the past twenty years. Alright, now run a scan on homogenized versus pasteurized skim milk. Okaaay, okay, now give me a breakdown of people who are seeking their parents who also suffer from a disease called T P S. Bingo. Do you have a photo My God. Oh my God! Thank you, Mr. President. I'm proud to be an employee of South Park Milk, which to date has found over a hundred thousand missing kids, and, led the way in the fight against curdling.

"JARED","Thank you all so much. You know what? After a year of eating delicious sub sandwiches, I've proven weight loss is easy!  And I promise you, I will always be your faithful leader in easy weight loss! Sure, let 'em in.  Hi kids. I sure did! And- Well- Well I, I also had a little help on the side. Well, eating sub sandwiches was a big part of it. But the way that I lost so much weight was that I got aides. That's right. I got aides about two years ago and I've been losing weight ever since. It's amazing how slim you can get with aides. Would you like to meet them? My aides. Scott, Tyler!  Scott is my personal trainer  and Tyler is my dietician. Yep. Hooray for aides! I know. You kinda have to read the fine print at the bottom of the screen. It says I only ate a half-sized lean turkey sandwich with no mustard or mayo or anything like that and then had proper diet and exercise aides. You, you think so. Well, why... should it matter? Hmmm. Christine, you know I love you very much, and I, I can't wait for the wedding. Yeh, I know I know, I know. But uh... some young boys were talkin' to me earlier, and... it made me think that people might not be so proud of my weight loss if they knew something. Uh Christine, this isn't probably gonna matter to you at all, but... I have aides. Yeah, I have aides. I've had aides since before we were together.  What, what are you thinking? Are you bummed? Well of course I knew it. I didn't think it was that big of a deal. Aren't you overreacting a little bit? We can still get married Christine, I mean, sure, they're my aides now, but after we get married... they'll be our aides  You'll love having aides, Christine, you really will. And when we have children, they'll have aides. It'll make things so simple!  Christine! Jeez, those boys were right. People really don't like aides. I'd better tell everyone the truth. Thank you-hoo, thank you all. Subway's is a healthy way to eat fast food and lose weight! But,  I feel like I need to come a little clean about something, uh-... it wasn't ...just Subway sandwiches that made me thin. The reason I was able to lose so much weight so quickly was that I got aides. But I still wanna be the leader in a fitter America, and so I'm here to tell you, that you should ALL go out and get aides! Having aides - is - awesome! With aides you can literally watch the fat melt away! And with the proper mix of aides and Subway sandwiches, anything is possible! Well, I appreciate your company doing everything it's done for me. ...'Scuse me ...am I being fired? How so? Ah hah. I never asked to be famous; now everyone hates me! I almost wish I had never gotten aides! I'm sorry, guys, but I...I think I wanna be aides-free for a while. Wait a minute... you're right!  Yeah! I think I know how to be a celebrity again! Ladies and gentlemen, a- at first I didn't understand why you felt betrayed by the fact that my aides helped me to lose weight, but now I understand that it isn't fair that- I had aides and most of you don't. And so, with all the money I've made from commercials, I have decided to start the Aides for Everyone Foundation! I am going to personally see to it that each and every one of you gets aides! But I won't stup there. I'm gonna seek out all the underprivileged and hungry children of the world, and I'm giong to give them aides myself! Yes, it is my hope that every beautiful child on this earth has aides by next month! Aides for everyone!! ...I tell my  girlfriend I have aides and she leaves, I tell the  world to get aides and they think I'm crazy, I offer to give aides to kids and everyone wants me  dead!  What's wrong with aides?! Why doesn't anyone want me to give them  aides?! Aahhh!! Why did I ever do those stupid commercials? Yes. ...Y-you mean you all thought...? Oh my Gosh! No no, hey it was my fault. I can't believe I I, I didn't think of what I was saying! Oh my God! I told my girlfriend I wanted her to share my ""AIDS"" - oh, no wonder she left! Oh, brother!"
"WORKER","Mr. Vogle, some fans wanted to see if you'd sign their sandwich? Hello? With what? No Kid, what are you doin' here? Kid, I don't know what you think is going on, but this place is a dump. No, I mean you're at the garbage dump. The town is right over there, everybody is fine, and I think they've been looking for you for over a week. Mr. Reiner, your bill to have smoking outlawed at bars here didn't pass. Apparently, several people here still believe there's no proof second-hand smoke can kill you."
"CHRISTINE","I love you too, Jared. You've changed my whole life. Jared, what's this all about? Uhwwwhat??? Am I bummed?!  You've had AIDS all this time and you knew it?! Why the hell wouldn't you tell me?! Not that big of a deal?! I slept with you! Well Jesus Christ! We're supposed to get married!"
"TYLER","Hey now, come on. What kind of talk is that? Yeah. Maybe they're all just jealous that they can't afford to hire their own aides."

You wanted to protect and serve, but mostly you wanted to protect yourself. Who were you protecting yourself from, Officer Barbrady? Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most like males between the ages of 8 and 10 and probably virgins. Parents notice that much toilet paper missing, so they would have to have bought it themselves. Find out where the toilet paper came from, officer, and you just might catch your man. The answer is right in front of you, but you can't see it. Tell me, the toilet paper. Was it quilted? Single-sheet? Why does one toilet-paper houses No, that is incidental. Your toilet-paperers wanted to transform the art teacher's house, thus transforming her entire occupation. Your uncle, who hit you with a belt. Was he a large man? Did he stink like bayer when he came home from work all powoor from playin' down at the pool hiyouse? Whoa. Uh, oh. Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most likely students in the art teacher's class, students who aren't very good at art. Fly along now, Officer Barbrady. You've got some arrests to make.  Fly fly flyyy. Fly fly flyyy. No, sir. What's the matter, Principal Victoria? Was your mother abusive? Did she spank your thighs with cold cuts and stick umbrellas up your ass?

Looks to me like you're not a ""hot shot"" after all. Oooooooo! You may think you've got what it takes, but as long as I'm around, you'll always be number two!  See ya leter, Darsh! well well well, if it isn't Stan Darsh! Say Darsh, you don't mind if I take Heather out for some fondue tonight, do ya?"
"THUMPER","We're gonna take it slow, take it easy, make sure everybody has a goood time. 'Cause what is skiing about? Having a good...?  Tiime, that's right. Now, just a few safety things to keep in mind: First of all, look straight ahead when you ski. You look down, you're gonna fall, you're gonna have a bad time. Also, be aware of skiers around you. You run into another skier, your skis are gonna cross, gonna have a bad time. Hey, little dude, you got some crap right here. Alright, we're gonna do this without any poles until we know our two primary feet positions. To go slow, we wedge our skis together , in the shape of a slice... of pizza. Then to go faster, we put 'em parallel, like... French fries.  You see that?  Pizza,  French fries,  Pizza,  French fries. Okay, let's have the little dude at the end try first! What's your name? Okay, Mike, ski down to me! Okay, you see what he did? He French-fried when he should've piiza'd. You French-fry when you should pizza, you're gonna have a bad time. K-13? But you're just a beginner! You ski outta your league, you're gonna have a bad time. Alright, well, if you gotta get good at somethin' really fast, there's only one way to do it. Come on!"
"HEATHER","Sorry, Stan, it's just that when it comes to skiing, Tad has all the right moves. You aren't mad, are you, Stan? I mean, a girl's gotta look out for her best interests. Stan, I was wrong about you. Would you like to go out again?"
"TAD","I just might show her my moves tonight, if you know what I mean. Still don't wanna race me? I told you he was chicken, Heather. Stan Marsh the Darsh! Allright, fine. You and me at the summit, now! Hah! You're going down, little boy! Yeah! Yeeaah! Yeah!! You lose, Darsh!! Yeah! No hard feelings, right Darsh??  Yeah!! Yeah! Hey everyone.  I'd like to sing a little song, if I may. This is a song I wrote about... Stan Marsh. A rematch? Oh, Darsh. You're ven dumber than I thought. Alright then, let's make it interesting. Tomorrow afternoon. On the K-13. Hell, I'm not chicken! Are you, Darsh?! Oh YEAH?! Oh, Darsh, you're even dumber than I thought! Again! See ya tomorrow. This time you're not just goin gto lose, you're gonna die! Haha.  This shoud slow down Darsh a bit! Now I'll win for sure!  TAD Huh, when Darsh skis by here, I'll let all these hamsters go. That should distract him just long enough for me to win the race! ...What are you doing up here?"
"TAD AND FRIENDS","Oooooooo! OooOOOOOOoooooo!"
"A SKIER","He's got it! Tad's gonna win it!"
"TEEN GIRL","Stan,  for what it's worth, I think you were really brave. Hey, all the cool teens are gonna be at the youth center tonight for a dance. I hope you'll come because you're just so... wehell, you're just so.. well, that's all. I'm glad you guys came. Do you like our youth center? But this time, if he wins, you get your dad to not close our youth center Oh Tad. Oh nothing. I just thought I could distract you. With these. Thanks a lot, Stan. Now we're gonna be able to keep the youth center. Go ahead, Stan. She's everything you ever wanted."
"LIFT OPERATOR","Can I help you? Ooooh, go right on ahead, folks."
"VOGUING SKIER","Yeah, too bad we're getting shut down. That hot-shot skier Tad's father is gonna bulldoze the building"
"THE LADIES","Ooooooooo."
"TEENS","Yeah!"
"A TEEN BOY","The K-13? But that's the most dangerous run in all of America."
"PHL","That's not true, officers, we said they could leave at any time."
"THIN COP","All right, let me see if I got this straight. You two gentlemen are offering part-time limited liability  ownership in one of your fabulous condos for the one-time price of eight thousand dollars? That's right, you're practically stealing condos at that price. ""Book 'em, Danno!"""
"FAT COP","Sounds to me like if anybody should be arrested it should be YOU people for passin' up such a great deal!"
"MAURY","Our next guest is a little girl who was born without a midsection. Please welcome Damla Jones You're a very brave little girl, and I'm very proud of you. Can you tell the audience how miseable your life is? You're a cutey. Do the other kids at school sometimes make fun of you? Do people sometimes stare at you? Do they go, ""Oh, gross. What the hell is that thing""? Well your mommy told us you like to listen to music. Well guess what, Damla. We're gonna give you a three hundred dollar gift certificate to CD World in Torrance! All right, everyone. Stay tuned, because next we're gonna meet a woman who head was smashed in on a locker! And we're gonna giver her a makeover!

Thanks so much for coming on our show. So, is it tough being ...different? And do all the kids at school make fun of you? Uh, yeah, but I mean, do the kids make fun of you because of your condition? You have balls that hang off your chin. What names do they call you at school? And do they call you ""freak"" and and ""weirdo""? Do they point at you and laugh? Do they make you wish you'd never been born? Make you wish to put an end to the whole... miserable wretched earth? Well Napoleon, we have a surprise for you. Because you're such a brave little chinballed man, we're gonna send you directly from this studio to the world's largest putt-putt golf course in the world! Go on, you're going right now!! We're here talking with moms who think their children are out of control. Vanessa here says that her thirteen-year-old daughter Vanity is already doing drugs and having sex with older men Vanessa, what does Vanity say to you when you tell her toooo... do her homework. Well, let's bring her out. Here's Vanity! Wow, Vanity, you are really an out of control teen. Our next mother is Liane Cartman. Her son claims to be the most out-of-control kid in the world and says there's nothing his stupid mom can do about it. So, Ms. Cartman, you can't control your child? Well, your son made a video backstage. Let's take a look. Well, let's bring him out. Here's Eric Cartman! Ms. Cartman, what does your son like to do? We're here, talking with moms who think their children are out of control. Now let's meet Joline. Joline says that her daughter is also out of control, that she's flirting with older men, and, she's only four months old. Let's bring her out: here's Chantal! So Joline, exactly how is your daughter out of control? You say she flirts with older men? Wow, that is out of control! What the hell is this? Ah, sorry America, a little glitch there, heh. Anyway- Wait! Come back, uh-... Maybe we can make the other out-of-control kids take... their clothes off, too! Ah, those damned freaks! I gave you shoes! And groceries! And this is how you repay me?!  Very well. Just come upstairs and... we'll negotiate! There a problem? Right. You have to buy wings if you wanna talk to the Raisins girls."
"DAMLA","Hello, Maury. Thank you Uh-uh, yes. It is. Sometimes. Sometimes Mmm-I don't know. Yes."
"BRUNET TREKKER","Now, we're going to apply the latex with some spearmint gum. We made a plastic mold of his chin, and then made a latex scrotum and put two golf balls inside. Wooww! Hey, hey! Stop it, man!"
"BLOND TREKKER","Now we just blend the skin tones, add a little hair,  and presto! I believe you owe us payment now? They weren't lying! Here, damnit!"

"MAN WITH NO LIMBS","I'm doing Jenny tomorrow. We don't take kindly to that. It's okay. Folks don't do it anymore. Not after what they saw what we did to Lobster Boy. Lying sack of crap. Why? You're not a SCAB, are you?"
"THE FREAKS","Unite! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Yeah! Yeah! Better prizes! Now! Better prizes! Now! Better prizes! Now!"

"HAMMERHEAD MAN","You're not gonna picket?"
"POLICE CAPTAIN","Okay folks, we're gonna have to move along. I'm sorry, but the government does not recognize you as a union. You'll have to go. Now now now, I'm not telling you people that your union doesn't matter, I'm just telling you that you're not really... people."
"MIDDLE DWARF","What are you saying? That because of our appearance our organization is less important?"
"JOLINE","Mmhmm, that's right Maurih. Maurih, it's like this: Whenever I have friends over to the house Chantal will come waltzin' in the livin' room completely naked! Why, just last night I had three gentlemen callers over to my house, and Chantal took her clothes off right in front o' everybody! You see?  There she goes. There she goes.  OH! YOU GOD-DAMNED WHORE!"
"ELEPHANT MAN","A lot of decent hard-working freaks in America are losing their talk-show jobs to freaks of a different nature. Sure, everyone in this great country of hours is a freak, but true, physically deformed freaks must be recognized, for it's these real freaks that make you all feel better about yourselves for not being one. So next time you're watching television, make sure it's a show with ""freak"" freaks, and not just with people that are freaks because they're stupid trailer trash from the South. That's what we mean when we say, ""Look for the True Freak label"""
"RANCHER BOB","I'm pleased to show you all the wonderful world of beef. Follow me. Now, out here you can see our cattle. This is where the magic begins as the cows eat and sleep and prepare for certain death. Now here we have the slaughterhouse. This is where we turn the cows into steaks and burgers. Hey, anybody want a free sample? And in here, boys and girls, we have our...  veal ranch.  You see, with veal the whole key is keepin' the cows chained so they can't walk around or get any exercise. That way, their muscle tissue stays soft, and makes for tender veal. Yeppir. Well, if we called it ""little baby cow"" people might not eat it. Well, no, but all these veals are goin' to the slaughterhouse tomorrow mornin'. They'll be steaks by tommorow afternoon and then you can buy them at your grocery store. I followed a calf-curling path right to your house, ma'am. Oh, why, why don't you just tell them that the cows will be safe. And when they come out I can take them back. Well that's just too bad. Look it, that's eight hundred dollars' worth of veal up there and I have to ship it out Friday. What are you goin' to do, Officer Barbrady? Oh.  Well, it doesn't matter now. You see, in the six days since the word ""veal"" was officially changed to ""little tortured baby cow"" the market has gone dry. Seems that people see ""little tortured baby cow"" on their menus, they don't feel like orderin'. Yep, damn things ain't worth spit now. I'll let 'em live outside with the other cows and live a normal life."
"HIPPIES","If we... fight together we can make sure the road is paved. Hooray! Hooray! All right! Woohoo! Yeah!"
"HIPPIE","We're with you boys! Your message is real and your voice is just."
"FBI NEGOTIATOR","Right here! Glen Dumont, Negotiator Squad"
"GLEN DUMONT","Give me a hard line to the phone in that house! Don't worry, I'm a negotiator. It's my job to talk to freaks like this and bring about a peaceful resolution using clever psychology. Hello, my name is Mike. I'm a negotiator. Is it okay if I talk to you? I'm here to make sure we can all end this peacefully. You want that, right? How about we make a trade, just show that we can trust each other. Well, how about you send out one of the calves? Just one, that's all we want. What? I, I can't do that. No no wait, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Yuh, you're right. What reason do you have to trust me? I'm just a guy from Lakewood trying to make ends meet, you know? Just a blue-collar guy like your dad. Oh. All right, fine, son of a gun, let me see what I can do. Okay. Up a little... left a little... Almost there. We're giving the boys some guns in return for our calves Hey, this is a negotiation process, okay? Did you people go to negotiator school? No, you didn't!  Get them on the line for me! Alright, you see that? I keep my end of the bargain. Well, ha- how about you send out two calves? I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Damnit, I'm losing them.  Okay, I'm sorry. Just send out one calf. What do you have in mind? A little to the left...  Okay, that's good. A little to the right. Stand down, ma'am! Stand down! This is a delicate process! I've almost earned their trust! How are we doin'? Weh ah I did manage to get the FDA to officially change the word ""veal"" to ""tortured baby cow."" But I couldn't get you North and South Dakota. Now, now please can, can we get you to come out? All right, everythng has worked out. The boys have promised to come out and bring the cows out with them. Yes. All we need to do in return is get a cattle-transporting semi-truck that will take the boys and the cattle to Denver International Airport, where we have a fully-gassed airplane waiting to take them all to Mexico. And they want the guy that plays Mr. Worf on ""Star Trek"" to drive the truck. In full makeup. All right, all right, I'll give you that. But in return, I want three staples."
"OFFICER BARBARDY","The terrorists already said there's no way they're coming out."
"MICHAEL DORN","I was woken up at three in the mornng, told I had to put on makeup, and come to this town.  What the hell is gong on?! This is highly unusual! My name is Michael Dorn. I play a character called Worf. Where am I supposed to drive to? Captain, where am I supposed to drive to? This whole thing is ridiculous! Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous. We cannot keep going fast on these icy roads! Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads. I'm NOT killing anybody! Can I go now?"
"FBI AGENTS","Mmrrrr."
"RUSSELL CROWE","Hello, everybody. I'm Russell Crowe, and this is ""Fight-in' Round The World"" . We're gonna have lots of fun tuhday as we travel all around, and and look for some good-  Ay! What the hell do yuh think you're doin'?!  You walked right through my shot, mate! Do you know who I am?! Oh! Get up! Get up, you little pussy! Come on! Well, that was a lot of fun, wadn't it, kids? But if looks like if we're gonna get in more fights, we're gonna have to go look for 'em. Well, that was a lot of fun, wadn't it, kids? ...we're gonna have to go look for 'em. Where should we go fight people next, Tugger? Great idea!  Tugger thinks we should go to the faaar away of China.  China is one of the oldest civilizations on earth. And from what I understand, they LOVE a good fight! So let's go! Oh my God, it's Russell Crowe! Oh my Gmah, bah bah byah byah!  Why don't you mind your own business, you scrotum?! What a glorious day to spend away fight-in' round the world. And so here we are in history-rich Choina. This is Tianinman Square. Lots of good foitin' has gone on here throughout the years, including a fan-tastic massacre that took place back in '93.  These chinamen can grow to over five feet tall, and in a fight, are known to kick with their legs. Let's see if we can get in for a closer look.  Oi!  I've gotten close enough now that they're startin' to get real froigh'ened. You can see the fine hairs on the back of their necks standin' on end.  Gotcha mate!  Ay, you wanna fight, huh?!  Think you could take me, you little buggers?! -bloomin' Taj Mahal. Freakin' Indian  doesn't even put up a  fight! Alright everyone, we're gonna take our first commercial break. But be sure not to go anywhere, because there's lot's more people to beat up. Making movies, making songs 'n fight-in' round the world.  Oi! Now Tugger's brought me to one of the greatest places for foightin' in North America.  Brooklyn, New York. Lots of minorities here, and they don't take kindly to whitey.  Let's get a closer look. Come on, Tugger! Looks like we got some black people, and some Puerto Ricans.  Notice the colorful rags on their heads, meaning they could be part of a gang, and therefor, real used to fightin'. Oh my God, it's the Gladiator guy! Oh my God, I've never seen an actor before!  Why don't you choke on some pig vomit, you stupid sops! Well?? You all just gonna stand there or are you gonna fight?  Croikey, you've done it now! You fight like Norwegians, ya fairies! These are the Florida Keys, a remote island chain just a few miles from... Oi! Wait a minute! Wasn't I just in Brooklyn fightin' minorities? What happened wit that? It's that God-damned editor! He cut the Brooklyn scene short! Tugger, I'm gonna get him! Who the hell do you think you are?! I know you're the bloomin' editor! I mean, who the hell do you think you are cuttin' one of my foightin' scenes short?! Moy foightin' is poetry! You don't edit Russell Crowe's poetry, you testicle! Come on, Tugger ol' mate. Why are you lookin' so down? Tugger's in a bit of a sad state. Seems his girlfriend and him had a bit of a row last night. Come on. Cheer up, Tugger. How can I make you feel better? I know!  How would you like me to sing one of the songs off me new album? What's that, Tugger? You say you really love the songs on my album? Alright then, Tugger. You know that you're my babih. You know I need you now. I don't know when I'm goin', but I gotta get there somehow, don't you know, somehow. We'll weather it somehow. You can stay away tonight, but I'm not... Tugger I feel your hearbeat, I know you feel my heart... Tugger!  Tugger shot himself! Tugger! Why'd you do it, Tugger?!  Doctor! Tell me how he is, doctor! You've gotta save him, Doc! Tugger! 'E's my best friend! The only friend in the world who would- Oi! Don't you interrupt me, you vagina! I was givin' a heart-wrenchin' soliloquy about me feelin's for Tugger! Oh, Tugger! Tugger, the world won't be as bright without ya, mate! Give it to me straight, doctor! Will Tugger live?! Tell me the truth! Yes, now's fine. Ooo, delolly! D'you hear that, everybody?! Tugger's gonna be okay! D'you know what that makes me feel like doin'? Fightin'! Crikey! Our Tugger looks healthy, happy, and  fit as a whistle! But you know, Tugger's attempted suicide made me realize that I should take up a cause. Most great actors take up causes, and I'm the greatest of them all! So, from now on i'm goona spend all my spare time ...fighting cancer.  Right! Where is that pussy cnacer anyway?! Well, we couldn't fight cancer, but we found a man with cancer.  Take that, cancer! And that! And so we'll be right back after these commercials. Well, we sure had a good time today, didn't we, kids? We fought some Chinamen, a few packers, and a lot of Colombians, to name just a few. But I sure am glad we got ol' Wally B. back. Aren't you?? Oh my God it's Russell Crowe! Oh my bluh bluh bluh!!

"ELDERLY PRIEST","Well, I don't know how it's been for all of you, but attendance at my church in Fort Rawlins is down sixty-three precent! Yes, we've gotta stop these boys from goin' to the public! How do you mean? Hih-it's okay, Father Maxi. We're all priests here; the doors are closed."
"FAT PRIEST","They've gotta know to keep their mouths shut!"
"OTHER PRIESTS","That right, yeah. Yeah."
"ITALIAN CARDINAL","Your Holiness, this is Father Maxi from America. He has brought this all to our attention. Adoramus te, Christe. Cardinals, bishops, and priests, an American priest by the name of-a Maxi has brought to our attention the most troubling of news. All over his-a country there are reports of children being molested by men of the Chuch. If things continue this way, we'll never be able to have sex with young boys again! Father Maxi, what do you suggest we do to not get caught. It is not written anywhere in the Holy Document of Vatican Law that sex with-a boys is wrong.. But-a the Holy Document of Vatican Law cannot be changed! You see, Father, the Holy Document of Vatican Law has been hidden away deep in the Catacombs of-a St. Peter's below us. Hidden away so that it can never be changed. Cardinals, bishops and priests! Father Maxi has returned! And he has the Holy Document of-a Vatican Law! Wait wait-a, the pope-a wants-a to say something.  The pope-a says we shall ask the highest source. The holy one!  Behold the great Queen Spider! O great Queen Spider, we seek a-your guidance. Go on, Priest Maxi. See if you can convince her. Gone! It's all gone!"
"FATHER MAXI","Your Holiness. That's right-wait. What? Not get caught? NO!! I, I think what we should do is not have sex with boys! Well, maybe we need to change the Holy Document of Vatican Law. Friends, we gather in this place to mourn the victims of yesterday's tragedy: nine good people who were run over in the street by an elderly woman driver. It is sometimes hard, in times like these, to understand God's way. Why would he allow nine innocent people to be run down in the prime of their lives by a senior citizen who, perhaps, shouldn't be driving? It is then that we must understand, God's sense of humor is very different from our own. He does not laugh at the simple ""man walks into a bar"" joke. No, God needs complex irony and subtle farcical twists that seem macabre to you and me. All that we can hope for is that God got his good laugh and a tragedy such as this will never happen again."
"OTHER CARDINALS","Et dominus..."
"FRENCH CARDINAL","In France as well we are finding it harder and harder to... make love to our boys. What exactly do you suggest we change, Father Maxi. Women?"
"MOROCCAN CARDINAL","In Morocco they have arrested five of my priests. It's only a matter of time before they get the rest of us."
"BRITISH CARDINAL","Speaking on behalf of the British Catholics, it is obvious that the priest doesn't realize that the Holy Document of Vatican Law can not be changed! How did he make it past the water lizards? Great Queen Spider, we seek to change one of the Vatican rules. Well, thanks a lot, Father Maxi. You've killed our religion."
"THE CLERGY","Yeah! It cannot be changed! Yeah! Hail Queen Spider!"
"GELGAMEK CARDINAL","Yes, and speaking on behalf of the Gelgamek Catholics, I believe we should move on to other solutions to this problem. The Gelgamek vagina is three feet wide and filled with razor-sharp teeth. Do you really expect us to have sex with them?! What's that about the Gelgameks?!"
"ANOTHER CARDINAL","The Holy Document of Vatican Law states that a priest, bishop, or cardinal cannot get married, so where are we to get our sex? Because we don't know where it is."
"A BISHOP","HA! Good luck, father! The document is guarded by water lizards, rattle snakes and sand traps! The fools who have tried before to recover it met their deaths! But the Holy Document of Vatican Law states that-"
"MARTHA STEWART","In the past few days we've all heard of the healthy benefits of interorectogestion, and so making food that can be inserted into the ass is essential.  Now, everyone knows that some foods are simple to shove up the ass - puddings, soups, raisins... this is a nice raisin pudding right here - but we can also still eat our favorite foods. What we're gonna do today is prepare a Thanksgiving turkey for interorecto.  Now, the key to shoving a turkey up your ass is first wrapping it in string, keeping the pointy wings neatly at the side. Not right now, I just wanna focus on my turkey,  right now.  Now, we're going to baste the turkey with lubricating gel rather than with juice - this'll help smooth the insertion later on. We still bake at four hundred degrees for twenty minutes a pound.  When it's done we'll get something like this. So now we're ready to go. Looks delicious. Let's try it out.  Aaaaa-... Yeah, get it up there. Yeah. AAAA. Yeeaahhhh. Phew. And that is how you eat a turkey. We'll be right back with more."
"OLD MONK","Beoo! What do you seek, Father? That Gospel...  lies somewhere beyond this door.  But... many troubles await thee inside! Only he whose heart truly belongs to the Lord shalla make it through. Then, prepare yourself. The time of trials begins.  Adoramus te, Christe! I wish you luck, Father. Use all the strength, agility, and faith that you have."
"QUEEN SPIDER","What do you ask of me? The Vatican rules cannot be changed. So saith the Spider"
"TED KOPPEL","A new movement is sweeping the country, led by four determined boys from South Park, Colorado. The organization was created to protect Hollywood's classic films from the hands of their directors. And also to free Hat McCollough. So boys, I ask you the question that's on everyone's minds, why does your organization want to free Hat McCollough, the convicted, confessed serial murderer of twenty-three babies? Well, Hat McCollough admitted he killed those toddlers? Why do you want him free? Just answer me this, Tweek: What do you see as ""positive"" about toddler murder? Yes... It is easy.  Alright, then on to your other cause, saving films from their directors. What got you boys interested in this, especially given your pro-toddler-murder status? Well I'm glad you said that, boys, because joining us now are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Gentlemen, these toddler-murder fans think you're insane and shouldn't be allowed to alter your films. Your response? How so?"
"GEORGE LUCAS","Oh hi, Ted. I'm not a Jew! Eh, that's brilliant! What are you doing?! You're the boys from that ...stupid club. Give me that! We're gonna make it better. The movie's gonna be changed, and that's that! ...What?? ALRIGHT, that does it! Yes, thank you, officer.  The police are on their way, boys.  Soon you'll be in jail getting RAMMED! It is... too late for me, boys. M-that's different. These are my movies. I made them, and I have the right to do whatever I want with them Have I... become so old that I've forgetten what being an artist is about? Perhaps... you are right. Steven, Uh, I- Steven, these boys had a point. I don't remember what it was, but it was good. I'm... ah I'm sorry, boys. AaaaAAAAA!!"
"GEOGRE LUCAS","You're here."
"TREY PARKER","When we first made South Park, we didn't wanna use construction paper. We just had to because it was cheap. Expensive. For instance, in the scene at the bus stop, we always meant to have Imperial walkers and giant dewback lizards in the background, but simply couldn't afford it."
"MATT STONE","And now with new technology we can finally remaster South Park, make it look sharp, clean and focused."
"HAT MCCOLLOUGH","Thank you everyone-KILL! KILL THE INNOCENT!! Uh, I'm so thankful for all your support-RAPE THE VIRGINS!! And uh, I just wonder if i could get a baby real quick?"
"POLLY PRISSY PANTS","Oh please, mister. Please let me out of here. Please, mister, let me out. I miss my Mom, mister. I wanna see my Mommy- Mister, please let me out of here. My parents have money, Mister. They'll give you whatever you want. Please!"
"POODLE","Bark bark bark bark!"
"MRS. STEVENS","Oho, sweetie, those are two completely different numbers.  Alright boys, time to be getting home. Bebe's not feeling well and she she can't come out today. Go one, shoo. What is it, Bebe? Oh, sweetheart, you're just becoming a young lady. Yes, darling, your breasts have a power that will unleash itself as you get older. They feed off the misery of boys and grow to bring woe wherever they can. You're blossoming into a woman. I think it's empowering for them. I mean, sure, if a man wants to be a whore, it's ""normal,"" but if a woman wants to be one, it's ""WRONG."""
"A DOCTOR","Well hello there, little girl. My name is Dr. Hallis. What can I do for you today?"
"DR. HALLIS","You? Well, young lady, I'm afraid that we don't offer breast reduction surgery to girls of your age. Because making breasts larger is a beautiful and wonderful thing. Making them smaller is... insane. Why do you... hate your breasts so? Oh, come on now, that's just silly. Oh, awesome. Thank you so much, Jillian. That's great. Oh, God-damn. Thanks you so much. Yeah, whatever. Get out of here.  Now, I was saying? Yeah, so? That's great, isn't it? That may be true, but I'm afraid I just cannot ethically perform a breast-reduction surgery on an eight-year-old girl. If, on the other hand, you'd like to make them a little bigger, I think now might be the right time to size up, hm? Young lady, are you absolutely sure you want to consider this kind of procedure for your breasts? Well, it is a different time, Mrs. Testaburger. Society puts a lot of pressure on your daughter to look her best. Having small breasts can make her feel unimportant. Yes, well, not too young to feel flat and therefore, not pretty. However, young lady, I'm afraid breast implants are not for everyone.  I'll need to carefully assess your physical and mental condition to see if augmentation is truly the best way for you to go. You pass. Let's do this thing. Suuure. Breast augmentation is now a very simple procedure.  What we do is make a small incision in the armpit where it won't be seen. Then we take this little plastic bag and gently place it in the chest where we fill it with salt water. Look. Us plastic surgeons have one philosophy. If we can help someone's self-esteem a little, then why not do it if they have to be a thousand dollars? Cha!  Gotta!  Jam it!  Up there!  Get! In!  There!  You!  Bitch!  Get!  In! There!  You!  Bitch!  Hah!  Okay, there's one, Wendy. Doing great."
"BLONDE NURSE","Here's the Anderson file, Doctor. What have we got?"
"BRUNETTE NURSE","And here's the coffee you wanted, doctor."
"RIGHT BREAST","The boys are at war. All is going as planned. We grow larger every day. Soon the entire tow- Ah, quiet."
"LEFT BREAST","Yes. Soon all the boys will be brought to their knees. And stronger. Sh! Sh! She's awake!"
"MRS. TESTABURGER","I tried to tell her she was too young. But she's eight! Oh, wait. You're gonna do it right now? I still don't know about this."
"ELDERLY LADY","Could you help me across the street?"
"DETECTIVE","Then we aren't too late. His name is Frederick Johnson. He's been abducting children by dressing up like the Ghost of Human Kindness for over a year now. Shiut up!!  You downloaded a lot of songs! Says here you even downlaoded Judas Priest? That's hard time you boys are lookin' at. You got anything to say for yourselves? Not a big deal! You think downloading music for free is not a big deal?! Put your couts on! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it! This is the home of Lars Ulrich, the drummer for Metallica.  Look. There's Lars now, sitting by his pool. This month he was hoping to have a gold-plated shark tank bar installed right next to the pool, but thanks to people downloading his music for free, he must now wait a few months before he can afford it. Come. There's more.  Here's Britney Spears' private jet. Notice anything? Britney used to have a Gulfstream IV. Now she's had to sell it and get a Gulfstream III because people like you chose to download her music for free.  The Gulfstream III doesn't even have a remote control for its surround-sound DVD system. Still think downloading music for free is no big deal? That is the folly of man. Now look in this window.  Here you see the loving family of Master P.  Next week is his son's birthday and, all he's ever wanted was an island in French Polynesia. I see an island without an owner. If things keep going the way they are, the child will not get his tropical paradise. Man must learn to think of these horrible outcomes before he acts selfishly or else... I fear... recording artists will be forever doomed to a life of only semi-luxury. It's all right. I think these boys learned their lesson. If you parents will just step over here, you can pay their four hundred dollar release and penalty fees. Not a big deal, huh?! Come with me! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it! Damnit! Another murder victim! For three years the Left-Hand killer has been at large and I've exhausted every lead! Maybe... I just don't have what it takes to be a cop anymore. All right, let's go, Murphy. Hang on a second, where are, where are my car keys? Doctor, didn't you say that kid suffereed head trauma?"
"TUONG","Hey. Hey hey!  Hey, what the hell you doing?!  Mongorians? What the hell Mongorians doing here?  Ey, fuck you, Mongorians! Tryin' break down my wall!  Get out of here, fuckin' Mongorians!  God-damnit, how come every time us Chinese put up a wall, stupid Mongorians have to come and knock it down? Okay. Finary.  Oh no.  It's those God-damned Mongorians again! Stop!

Eh, eh, there we go.  All finished. My Mongolian Missile Defense system. Those Mongolians try to break down my city wall again, they gonna get a big heat-seeking missile surprise! Oh! Hello Mongolians. Yeah. You come to break down my city wall?  Oh, you gonna throw that baseball at my wall?? Oh no! Not a baseball! I'm pretty scared. Well, you know what? I might have something here that's a little bigger than a baseball. Say hello to my little friend!  Aw, crap.  Ooohhhh  God-damned Mongolians!! You break down my city wall foda last time!! Hahahaha! My masterpiece!  When those Mongolians come next time, I pour this sweet and sour pork on their heads. Haha, sweet and sour pork so hot and sticky, Mongolians'll stick ahright up to the wall! And scream ""UhwOoOoOoOoo!"" Oh I can't wait.  Oh, I get it. A Trojan Mongolian horse. Mongolians a-hiding inside thinking that I'll bring it in city wall, then Mongolians pop out and destroy wall from the inside out without gettin' any sweet and sour pork on their heads! Okay. I'll pray around.  Oh! Oh rook! Rook, my very own Mongorian Trojan horse! Gee, what a surprise! I guess Mongorians aren't such crappy, smelly people after all!  Yeah. Great! Rwow!  Yeah, what a great present! I'm just gonna push it inside the gate and soon tell all my friends.  Oh, it's sweet and sour pork!  Oh! I'm going to get you Nogodians, if it's the last thing I do! Ah. Hey daw. O'er 'ere. O'er 'ere, dog. Got som'in sweet and souh foh ya.  Good dog! That's it! Keep licking, dog! Hahahahahaaa! I'm free, Mongolians! And now I'm gonna make you PAY! Awright, Mongolians! Your only way through this wall is through me. This is my rast stand! I'm gonna do my war dance now.  Does my war dance ascare you, Mongolians? Yeah, you think you want a piece of this?  This is ancient Chinese dance of a- Oh, herro kids. Uh be careful, there's a-Mongolians up there.  Oh, crap! God-damned Mongolians attacked city wall again! Aw, you'd better not say what I think you're gonna say."
"MR. GOODMAN","Isn't it awesome havin' a great wall around our city? Nobody in town except for our good friends. Nineteen six- Go on, kids! Go! Go and don't look back! Kids? Don't you remember us? We are your parents. You used to live here, with us. Are you okay, Clyde? You mean how he said we should trust each other, or how he abducted children?"
"MONGOLIAN","De bandig baeakhalah?"
"MAN IN BACK","Mongolians??"
"LOLLY","Oh that's great! Okay! Well I'll just need your ticket stub. Well you know. When you entered the contest you got the other half of this ticket. Don't need the ticket stub?? Are you high?? How else do I know you're the winners? Sh-orry boys. No ticket stub, no candy shopping spree. If you find it, you can come back, but you only have one week to claim the prize. That's called ""The Ticking Clock."" Works great in the movies. All right. There you go. Hold on to that ticket stub. You'll need it to claim your prize.  Shign up for the five-minute shopping spree!! There you go. Hold on to that ticket stub."
"ROBOT GUARD","Wewewewewewe..."
"RANDY MARSH","Well, our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend Kenny again and... and that he thought it would work...  if he... built the ladder to heaven."
"ALAN JACKSON","Where were you when they built the ladder to heaven? Well I, for one, believe in the ladder to heaven. Where were you when they ran out of stuff to build the ladder to heaven? Where were you when they saved that ladder to heaven? Where were you when they decided heaven was a more intangible idea 'n you couldn't, you couldn't really get there?"
"FAT MAN","If... heaven is an eight-year-old boy, and the ladder is my penis...  and the pearly gates are the- I, for one, believe that if Saddam Hussein were an eight-year-old boy, and my penis were the United States...  then there would-  hard nipples!"
"SNN CORRESPONDENT","This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting rive from Tokyo, where Japan has started buirding its own radder to hayben. Ahready, the Japanese radder extend faaar into space  and it's growing by a-one thousand miles every day.  As the endeavor continues it is becoing clear that Japan will reach a-hayben before the United States. This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting rive from hayben.  The great a-nation of Japan reached a-hayben today about eight o'crock Pacific Standard Time-eh. Therefore hayben is now a-decrared an official part of Japan, because we got a-here first. And now for the weather in heaben, let's go to Natsako Semu."
"NEIGHBORS","Nahurabo Nahurabo"
"BUSH","Alright, how's the ladder going, General? Are we beating the Japanese. Saddam Hussein? But... we killed him! We secretly took him out months ago! Dear Christ, that sonofabitch just doesn't stop! That tricky bastard! Ladies and gentlemen of the UN, we have evidence that Saddam Hussein is up there building weapons of mass destruction. We have tried to communicate with Saddam through a psychic to ask him to let us see his warehouses in heaven. But he has not responded. Right. Dead, and in heaven. Our intelligence tells us that when Saddam was originally killed, his soul actually went to hell. But while in hell he began a homosexual relationship with Satan, the Prince of Darkness. Satan, however, decided he didn't want to be with Hussein anymore and broke up with him about August.  When Saddam became jealous and tried to kill Satan's new lover, Chris, Satan had Saddam sent to heaven to live with Mormons as a punishment.  Question?  Yes? I assure you, I am not high. Good. As soon as the boys finish their ladder we'll be ready to take Saddam out. And I was dumb enough to believe Saddam could actually be up there buildin' bombs."
"DICK CHENEY","That... kinda looks like a seagull."
"WAR PROTESTER","War is not my voice! This country is just run by rednecks and bumpkins with their guns!"
"REDNECK","We have to take Saddam out to protect ourselves."
"BOYFRIEND","It's gonna be okay, babe."
"INDIAN AMBASSADOR","Of course he has not responded, because he's DEAD!"
"ANOTHER AMBASSADOR","This is preposterous! Even if there was a heaven, what makes you think Saddam Hussein's soul would be sent there? Are you high, or just incredibly stupid?"
"NATSAKO SEMU","Todeh weather in hebon, partry croudy."

Mr. Slave, I think you and Wendy better have a little talk. I'll make some cocoa. Thank you sweetie. Honey, I didn't work to become a whore, I was born a whore. I've been one... ever since I can remember.  Ever since I was a little boy I seemed to enjoy... different things. As I got older, I felt that one boy was never enough. So you see, I can't make you into a whore, Wendy. But why would you want to be one anyway? A what?? For God's sake, where?? Oh Jezuth!  Kids, kids! Girls, what on earth are you doing? Okay, I think this has all gone far enough! Now look, the last person you want to be like is Paris Hilton! Paris Hilton is a nobody! She may have money, but she's a thoughtless, talentless lowlife! Hon, will you just tell these girls that being a whore isn't such a great thing. Look girls, I've partied a lot. Okay? And I'm telling you, there's more to life. Sweetie, really, don't go there, okay? Sweetie, listen, I know you've done some partying in your private little rich life, but you don't even wanna know the kind of stuff I've done. I'm the real whore, and I'm telling you, it isn't great. Jezuth.  Ohoho, Jezuth. People, don't applaud me. I'm a dirty whore.  Being spoiled and stupid and whorish is supposed to be a bad thing, remember? Parents, if you don't teach your children that people like Paris Hilton are supposed to be despised, where are they gonna learn it? You have to be the-  ooohooho, Jezuth Christh. You have to be the ones to make sure your daughters aren't looking up to the wrong people. No thanks. I can't believe you just went ahead and had that surgery without even asking me what I thought. But I'm gay! I don't like vaginas! It's great that you feel better, but you never stopped to think about how other people around you would feel! How can you say that?! You're gay too! Oh, Jezuth Christh!"
"THE OTHER KIDS","Yeah. Oh yes, tell us Dad. Yeah Dad. All right."
"TOUR GUIDE","Welcome to the Museum of Tolerance. Here we try to educate you on the dynamics of racism and prejudice in America. Now, did you know that words we use can show intolerance?  Let's begin our tour with a walk through our Tunnel of Prejudice, to show you what it can feel like to be discriminated against. Now you know how it feels. We are now entering the Hall of Stereotypes. These wax figures represent how some intolerant people have labled minorities. Here we see a black person eating chicken and watermelon, a stereotype that hurts the African-American community. What other stereotypes do you see here? That's right. But of course, we know that all Arabs are terrorirsts, don we, kids? That's right. Not all stereotypes are negative. But even a positive one like ""All Asians are good at math"" is harmful to society. Very good, young man. The idea that Jews are only interested in money is very old indeed. This is our discovery wing. Take your time at the computer displays , because you see, being tolerant you must also respect people who are small, people who are disabled, even people who are overweight,  like this young man here. You other boys have probably called this young man names like ""tubby,"" or ""lardbutt,"" or ""fat tits,""... But you must learn to be tolerant of his differences as well. If he chooses to eat fatty foods, that's his life choice. And we won't belittle you for eating lots of cookies and cakes and pies. Well, that's the end of our tour. We have to accept people for who they are and what they like to do.  Hey! What the hell are you doing? There's no smoking in the museum! Get out of here, you filthy smoker! Well, have a great day, everybody. Tonight we are here to honor an amazing fourth grade teacher with the Courageous Teacher award.  Herbert Garrison came out about two years ago. Since then he has faced adversity. He has even faced ridicule by some of the students. It is my honor to present the Courageous Teacher award to... Herbert Garrison."
"JANITOR","Wai-what? Oh man, what time is it? Naw, man. I'm the janitor. I'm s'pose to be cleaning but I'm so tire. Ongh, so sleepy. Are you sure you got everything you need, young man?"

Make for the large intestine. All will be made clear then. Lemmiwinks, you are coming to the entrance of the small intestine. Now you must seek out the Sparrow Prince. Hang on, Lemmiwinks!

I was just about to go asleep in an alley behind the crackhouse,  and I shot up a little heroin, and then this electrical storm started. Next thing I knew I was running around in my own past, man. I thought... I was just tripping, but then I came down and I was still here. Oh, dude, it's so bizarre! Thanks. Can I get another beer? That'd be killer. Where can I crash? Whoa, Kyle and Cartman! It's so cool to see you guys. Yeah, I spent a lot of my teenage years on a slow downward spiral experimenting with drugs and alcohol. Oh, I don't know. You guys stayed away from drugs, so you're okay. I just lost touch with you after I was sent to Juvi Hall in 2006. Yes, former self? Oh, uh... Sure uh, uh,  oh man, could you all excuse me for a second? I think I'm gonna crap my pants. Yes, well, it's hard to find work in commercials, so I ended up- Oh, dude, how's it goin', man? Ey, you wanna go upstaris and play hide and go seek? Oh, Jesus Christ! Help me!"
"BECKER","My name is T. Becker. The T stand for Terrific."
"FUTURE BUTTERS","Stan! Sure I remember you. Yep. Wearing that puff-ball hat like always."
"MR. BROOKS","We sure hope so. We just don't know how to talk to our son about drugs. Heh it sure should, heh. Oh, and that's when uh you'll fake the electrical storm as well?"
"MRS. BROOKS","My goodness, he does look a little like Kevin. Woohoo, that should get Kevin to stay clear of drugs. ""Listen to me, you crazy person, there's no way you can be from the future."" Oh this is going to be fun."
"MR. CASHER","I'm going to tell him that I dropped out of school and went to prison for eight years, where I was sodomized. In the ass."

You stop eating junk food and you start studying harder, you stay away from drugs and alcohol and you become CEO of your own time-travel company!"
"COUSIN KYLE","Av-a-a-alright, I'm done. Ye-yes, I-I've tallied up all the times you've been naughty and deducted the times you've been nice. It doesn't look good, Eric. It doesn't look good. a-a-aactually it looks like you're gonna owe Santa three hundred and six presents. Four thousand three hundred and twelve instances of being naughty against three deductions of being nice, is is, is bad. Yes, wa-a-I didn't think ""hitting Clyde in the balls with slingshot"" really counted as nice. Ye you can't deduct things like that, Eric. Santa will know and then he'll come after you. Hey hey,  I'm just your naughty-and-nice accoutant! Don't blame me for the numbers! But what, look, aren't there any other nice things you've done recently we can write off here? Eh... brushing your teeth isn't naughty or nice... Eric, it just, it falls more into the category of... brushing your teeth. If you cure cancer... and AIDS next week, you would still owe two presents. Ah I'm afraid you're gonna have to find a way to do... the nicest, greaatest thing anyone has ever done. Ever."

America wants to bomb my house, my main man. They want to kill my wife and children. We need to know... what is their plan? They say that the Chinese were the first to experiment with a little shock to the testicles. What else is America planning?! You're not in a position to kill anyone, my main man! I just want you to tell me America's plan! You're a sick capitalist dog, my main man! Drink it! Drink the oil! This is all you Western capitalists want! Ach!"

Well the prostate seems to be normal. No swelling of the hemorrhoidal gland... Wait, what's this? I've never quite seen this before, uh... Perhaps he just needs some hemorrhoid cream. I've never seen a hemorrhoid react this way."
"JEFF","How do we uh, make it come out? Can I see this thing, please? It, it's sending a transmission of some kind.  Got it! Whoever they are, if they're receiving messages, they might be sending them, too. Wait a minute. c-candy bars. Yu-you know. Candy bars. They usually come in a wrapper. Just like you... wrap a Christmas present. Christmas happens when it's cold. Cold, as in Alaska - that's... with polar bears. Polar bears... pola... polarity! I can switch the polarity to see what transmissions are coming from the location this one is being sent to!  What the heck?  They're coming in! What?? Oh no! When I reversed the polarities, I found this:  It's a message that the aliens are broadcasting throughout the entire universe. But I have no idea what it says. Wait a minute! Butt sex! Butt sex requires a lot of lubrication, right? Lubrication. Lubruh... Chupuh... Chupacabra 's the, the goat killer of Mexican folklore. Folklore is stories from the past that are often fictionalized. Fictionalized to heighten drama. Drama students! Students at colleges usally have bicycles! Bi, bian, binary. It's binary code! Ladies and Gentleman, we have recently come across an alien transmission that is being beamed throughout the entire universe.  When decoded, it looks like this. Ih it's simple mathematical language that can be understood throughout the solar system. Translated into our language, it looks like this. I'm afraid that Earth, a-all of Earth, is nothing but an intergalactic reality-TV show. Waaaait, you don't understand! There's a huge ship of some kind in Earth's orbit!  But why? Wait a minute! Chaos theory! Chaos theory, ih wah, it was first thought of in the sixties. Sixty. That's the number of episodes they made of Punky Brewster before it was cancelled. Cancelled... Don't you see? The show is over! The aliens are cancelling Earth! Oh, their ship is massive! There's no way to stop it!  Wait a minute, jackets! If people don't wear jackets they could get cold. A cold is caused by a virus. A viru- a computer virus! We could make a computer virus and send it to their ships to disable their computers!"
"NAGIX","The universal network heads. They say the Earthlings have become aware of the show, so it won't be fuinny anymore. Everyone, can I have your attention real quick? Uuh, look, I just got a call from the network and I'm afraid Earth has been cancelled Now, now, it was a great run and I think we should all be really proud.  Let's call in a demolition crew to strike the Earth for resources. Wouldn't do any good. All right, kids, we'll take you to the network heads. But I warn you: nobody has ever gotten the executives to uncancel a show once the call has been made. Nobody."
"STAFF","Awww."
"REEVE","Thank you, thank you, wow, what a great audience.  I just flew into South Park. Used to be I didn't need an airplane. As most of you know,  I am a strong supporter of stem-cell research. Though it is controversial,  stem cell research is critical  in the quest for helping  the disabled. In the coming days  I will prove to the world  that stem-cell research is a miracle. Thanks for having me on again, Larry. Well, it just proves that the public needs to be educated  about stem-cell research. See, the stem cells from a fetus like this one  can form into whatever cells of the body are damaged. They are the most powerful thing on the planet. Well, it's very simple.  And now you can see, my arms have better movement. Thank you everyone.  To most people, this is just an ordinary fetus. But to people like me,  it's hope. Where's that delivery of new fetuses?! Feeling weak again. Well, well, Gene Hackman, my nemesis from the movies. How are you? I am better with each passing day. Stronger and more agile. What? And go back to the way I was? Is that what you're saying, Hackman? Stop calling me Christopher! That name no longer has meaning to me! Christopher was someone who lived in a wheelchair! Always being pushed around by others! The old Christopher Reeve is dead! From now on, I am...  Chris! Hello, Gene! So good to see you! Stem-cell research has made me stronger than I ever thought possible! Why stop now?! Stop me?! Stop me?! HA!!  You won't stop me, Hack Man!  Ha HA! Ha HA! Ha haa haa!  Ya ha ha! Yaa haha! I have chosen each member of this elite group of supervillains for their outstanding treachery,  Their desire for world conquest, and their hatred of all things good! And I've assembled this group for one purpose! To once and for all find a way to...  get rid of Hack Man!! Silence! OUR job is to see to it that Hack Man is put out of commission. Hack Man! No...  NOOOO!"
"MCGILLICUDDY","Hello, boys. What can I do for you? Uh... boys, I don't think you wanna wear these shirts Well, because there already is a group that calls themselves the Crips, and I don't think they'd like it too much. Well, sure, they're all over at Five Points area in Denver. You've never heard of them? ...Oh, I am stayin' out of this one."
"KING","My guest tonight is the brilliant star of stage and screen, Mr. Christopher Reeve, who,. with the help of stem-cell research, is now able to move his arms. All right. Chris, the whole world is waiting. Why don't you show us what stem-cell research has done for you. Amazing. Isn't that amazing, folks? Now, Chris, there're some people who say stem-cell research is wrong, that takling cells from a fetus is... unethical. And how does someone like yourself make use of the stem cells, Chris? Wow.  Wow."

"HACKMAN","I'm good. You? Christopher, I've come to ask you to stop what you're doing? Using stem cells is like playing God. You should leave nature alone. I'm saying that sometimes you need to just live with the cards you're dealt, Christopher. Chris, that's enough! You're cured, Chris. It's time to stop using stem cells. They're affecting your mind, Chris. If you won't stop using stem cells, then we'll stop you! Not so fast, Chris! We just helped pass a ban on stem-cell research. Your fetus-sucking days are over!

Nnoo, the only Mexican guy I recall bought toasted tarts and chips and... we don't allow Middle Eastern people in the store.  Oh my God!"
"POLICEMAN BROWN","He... He was too fast for me. He ran out the door! Well, ah I'm covered in toilet paper. I'd look silly."
"SUPPORTERS","Yeah! Right! Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! Support! Country!"
"TIVO","Your TiVo is full."
"JEFFERSON","Hello. I am Thomas Jefferson. Very well. Take this document to the Continental Congress. Some favir going to war with England and others want to avoid war at all cost. Perhaps this document will make the reasons for war obvious to all. Good luck, young messenger!  Now make haste! Yes. Yes of course. We go to war, and protest going to war at the same time. Weeeeeee, look at us on the swing! We're swinging!"
"HANCOCK","Mr. John Adams? Will you do the honors of reading the document to Congress, please? Mr. Franklin, where do you stand on the war issue? And we will call that country the United States of America."
"ADAMS","Aye. WHEN in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one People to rise up-  -we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor. We have no choice, Mr. Dickinson. We must go to war! We cannot found a country that is afraid to fight! It's like having your cake, and eating it, too."
"A CONGRESSMAN","Excuse me, but does this Declaration actually suggest that we should go to go war with England?"
"SOMEBODY","Yeehaw!"
"DICKINSON","But what about the violence?! The lives lost?! If we found a country, it should be founded on peace and diplomacy. Don't you call us unpatriotic! We're protesting this war because we care so deeply for the fate of our Colonies! You are all unpatriotic for leading the Colonies into a war that half of them don't want! We cannot found a country based on war! Right. If the people of our new country are allowed to do whatever they wish, then some will support the war and some will protest it."
"CONGRESSMEN","Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble! Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble!  Oh my, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin."
"FRANKLIN","I believe that if we are to form a new country, we cannot be a country that appears war-hungry and violent to the rest of the world. However, we also cannot be a country that appears weak and unwilling to fight to the rest of the world. So, what if we form a country that appears to want both? And that means that as a nation, we could go to war with whomever we wished, but at the same time, act like we didn't want to. If we allow the people to protest what the government does, then the country will be forever blameless."
"TOGETHER","When you put us together you get a nation with one goal"
"A COUNCIL MEMBER","Hahahahaha, oh my."

Wu-well a very talented younger singer has come to our attention and, and the truth of the matter is her name happens to be Jennifer Lopez as well. And we really can't have two here at BHI Records.

"THE BOY","Agent Tucker, FBI! And you?"
"TUCKER","...Not anymore, you're not! Can't we? You guys are playing Detective. We're playing FBI. That gives us jurisdiction over you! I want choppers on the roof ready to go! Good. Then you can help us by telling me everything you know. Attention! You in the house!  This is Agent Tucker with the FBI! We have you surrounded. Sort of. And you did a great job leading us here. Now you just stay out of our way!  The gig is up, Fosse! Bring out the doll! Or we'll tell on you! No you're not. Time out, kid! We say you can't charge the front door, and you have to obey what the FBI says! That's the rules! Yes it does so! Come on guys. You don't wanna hurt that doll."
"DAWSON","Hello there little crime stoppers, I'm Lieutenant Dawson with the Park County Police. I heard you did a great job finding Sarah Peterson's doll. W-hell, that's fantastic, kids. And for all your terrific sleuth-solving, I'm hereby making you all Jenior Detectives. That means you boys are now an official part of the department. All right, so ready for your first assignment? Okay. There's a meth lab down at 567 Mala Vista. The operators are probably armed to the hilt with illegal weapons. I want you to get down there and see what you can find! I don't want any problems. Just take them down by the books. Now get over there; the mayor's all over my ass on this one!  On, and deputies: you screw this up and I'll have you working graveyard shift behind a desk! Move it! One UPS vehicle valued at twenty-five thousand dollars, one civilian vehicle valued at sixteen thousand, the second floor of the post office AND a coffee shop valued at sixteen thousand! The mayor's gonna have my ass! You got careless! Now, I don't know how they do things down at that dog-and-pony show they call the Fourth Grade, but here we have rules! Jesus, we don't have guys to question now, because you killed them all! One more slip-up like that and I'll have your badges! You hear me?! Now hit the showers! What the hell is the problem here?? Then hit the showers, all of ya! Marsh! Broflovski! McCormick! Cartman! In my office! Looks like that meth lab you took down was the tip of the iceberg. They found a paper trail leading all the way to the biggest crime syndicate in Colorado. The operators apparently run their business out of a sleazy strip joint down in Inglewood. They're all cop killers, so I'm sending you in undercover. What?! Now you listen to me! I'm givin' you one last chance! You're good cops, but you let your emotions get in the way! And your little ""shoot first ask questions later"" technique has no place in this century! Now you get down to that strip joint and you do it by the books, you got it?! The mayor is on my ass and blablablah! God damnit! Those junior detectives and their heroicly reckless ways! Murphy! Jenkins! Hopkins! Get in there! Christ! Those junior detectives have no regard for the law! Who the hell are you?? Hey, I'm in charge of this investigation. But that's not fair! All right, detectives, let's get one thing straight! I do not agree with your methods! You're uncontrolled, and you're negligent! But by God you get the job done. Congratulations! I'm probably going to regret this, but, well, I'm promoting you to full detectives. There'll be lots of action, and that big paycheck you've always wanted."
"HOPKINS","I said, back off Murphy! Freeze! South Park detectives!  Great job, boys. You found the meth boss! A deal? Boys! Down! It looks like Murphy and Jenkins got what they deserved. If it weren't for you boys, we would have never cleaned up the department."
"STRIPPER","Would you like a dance? Dance?  Anyone like a dance? Dance? Anyone like a dance? Oh, really? Let's go see. Dance??? Anybody like a dance???"
"OWNER","All right, so we'll have to start havin' the McCormicks make our meth again and-"
"GINO","What? Ha-I don't know no kids. Hey wait a minute. These kids might be just what we need to get our drugs past the security at DIA. How would you like to join our family? What? Detective Murphy! Jenkins! Uh what the hell are you doing? We had a deal. That's right. We split it all, fifty-fifty!"

"RUNS WITH PREMISE","Halt.  I am afraid minors cannot go onto the casino floor. You kids can enjoy our Native American Comedy Club. Look at them! Small-minded idiots pouring their life-savings away! Yeessss. It is time for us to implement our plan.  A superhighway, built from Denver right to our casino! Simple. We buy it, and we demolish it! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! We're sorry. But if we do not build a superhighway, our casino might stop seeing profits. Well like what? The residents of South Park had hoped to raise three hundred thousand dollars. but in the end managed to raise only ten. The loss of their town may be imminent for the poor people of South Park. Awww, I think I'm going to cuwhy. What are they doing? Impossible! Thirty one. Black. No... NOOO! Hmmm! Get out of our way! Boys. It isn't your town anymore. Damnit! I thought you said they were dealt with! This isn't over! What is the state of our people? Then we must force the South Park people off their petty land. I already have a plan how we can force them off our land... sneakily.  We're going to give them...  blankets. Yes. We will present the blankets as a peace offering. But what the round-eyes will not know is that the blankets are infected with SARS.  They will all get SARS! And then SARS will run through their town like a buffalo. Now I need your help getting the SARS onto the blankets.  Okay, bring them in!  Let's see how South Park deals with this! Everyone grab a Chinese person and rub them on a blanket.  Make sure you rub them all over. Get the SARS nice and deep in there. Free blanket?  Though I know we have differences, we believe a compromise can be reached. In the meantime, it hurts us to see you all on television sitting in the cold. Will you not take this offering as a gesture of goodwill? Please. As a token of good faith. It is only a blanket, Mister Marsh. Oh. You're welcome. How much longer must we wait for our superhighway?? Then I suppose we must be patient. What is the matter, wife? Premise Running Thin, what is the matter? No! I told you not to touch them! Now, I will blow your weak, SARS-infested bodies off the Earth!  What the?  Wait a minute.  Stop! Stop!  Your, your SARS. Where did it go? My son... Premise Running Thin has the SARS as well.  You... you can cure him? You have cured Premise Running Thin. In return, I shall give you all five dollars credit at the casino.  All right, all right, I will not build a superhighway through your town. And you can all have your homes back."

"BLACKSMITH","There goes that kooky Joseph Smith"
"SMITH","Well it's true. I did. I was out in the woods, praying  I was asking God if I should be a Protestant, or a Catholic, or what? And suddenly God and Jesus appeared before me.  And they said I should start my own church, because none of the others had it right. And that's exactly how it happened. And please bless Mother and Father, and please keep our bellies full of yum-yums and luscious goodies.  AAAHH! Oh my gosh! A...  Native American?  But your skin is white. Jesus live here in America? Wooww... I found them! I found them!  You're not gonne believe it, everybody! I found them! Another New Testament of Jesus Christ! Last night, a Native America angel told me where I could find another testament of Jesus Christ, so I went out to the woods. I dug around all morning where the angel had told me to look. Maybe there isn't anything out here. Wait a tick!  What's this?  Wow... Inside the stone box, I found the magical seer stones. Under that, I found four gold plates written in strange writing . This must be the Gospel that Jesus told the Nephites! Well, they were the most amazing things I'd ever gazed upon. Where are what? Oh. Oh, well, I... was not allowed to take them. You see, after I found the plates, the angel Moroni appeared to me again and said that I am not allowed to show the plates, or the seer stones, to anybody. Because first I must translate what's written on the plates into English, so you can all read it! Mr. Harris, can you keep a secret? I have, in my possession, an ancient book written on gold plates that tells of Jesus Christ's second coming. Here, in America. It's true. And I'm going to translate the plates and publish it into a book for the whole world to read. Now, ahah-I know you have a lot of money, Mr. Harris, and I'm just gonna need a little bit to pay for the publishing costs. With these. They're not rocks. They're seer stones, given to me by an angel. With them, God allowed me to translate the plates into English. Watch. You take this quill and paper and write down what I say. Sit here.  I have the golden plates here in this hat. I need to have them somewhere dark so I can read the spiritual light. Now, when I put the seer stones into the hat, the ancient letter light up and change into English, which I can then read to you. Ooo, I'm seeing the light. Oh, okay. Write this down. ""And... so... it... was... that... Christ... appeared before... the... Nephites."" I would love to, Martin, except, I just had a vision. And the Lord said he's very angry with me for letting you take those pages. Yes. He is so mad that he will never let me translate from the plate of Lehi again. He's... we must now translate from the plate of Nephi. So it will be the same basic story, but written a little differently."
"MORONI","Yes. Long ago all Native American were white. We all came to America from Jerusalem. And while we were here we were visited by Christ. Yes. Eventually, my people were all killed by the other tribe of Israel, and as punishment, God turned their skin red. These are the Native Americans you know today. There is an ancient book buried near here, written on gold plates that account my people's lives. Also buried with the book are two seer stones, the Urim and Thummim, which will allow you to translate the writings. Find it, and fulfill your destiny."
"MR. HARRISON","Hello! I sure am.  The, the name's Gary."
"GARY SR.","Oh, you're Stan's dad! It's so nice to finally meet you! Karen! Mr. Marsh is here! I cannot tell you how wonderful it is to have you over. Oooh... Oh boy... you think we were trying to convert him. Oh, Mr. Marsh, I am sooo sorry. You just heard your son talking about religious ideals that aren't your own and you said ""Who the heck do these people think they are?!"" I I'm really, truly sorry, Mr. Marsh. It won't happen again. To each his own, right? Well, because they found ancient books they had written on gold plates, right where the angel Moroni said they would be. Hey, just what the heck am I supposed to be? Well... Gary, you wanna just hang out with your friend Stan? Yeah. Have a good time, boys. Ohohoho, really? Wel, that's just because he hasn't heard the best part about the Joseph Smith story! The one that proves he was for real! Well, you remember Martin Harris, the rich man who wrote down what Joseph Smith read out of the hat? See, after he was done, he took some of the pages of what would become the Book of Mormon home. And that's how it happened. Well sure. The story proves it, doesn't it? Yeah, it's great you have your own beliefs. Well kids... Who's up for a water balloon fight?!"
"KAREN","Oh, Mr. Marsh! What a treat! It's so nice to meet you! With chocolate frosting I hear you're a geologist. That is so amazing. We just moved here from Utah and we're so used to everyone being Mormon that we... Oh, we forget not everyuone wants to hear about it. Oh boy, you must be furious! Randy, the last thing we want is for people to think we're pushing our religion. We know there are a lot of beliefs out there and ours just works for us. Look, we painted our faces! Aw, we'll all see each other tonight when we go to Stan's house for dinner. Stay and play with your friend, Gary. You must be Mrs. Marsh; it's so nice to meet youuu!"
"GARY SR","Karen just finished baking the most amazing Rice Crispy squares. Come on out of the cold. You've gotta try one. Or six."
"THE HARRISONS","Hey you guys! Yeah! Woohoo!"
"HARRIS","Well, sure I can. In America?  Really? That sounds kind of... Mmm, I don't know. Uh, how do you expect to translate it? Rocks? Really? Wow! A-and so Joseph Smith put his head into a hat, a-and read to me what the golden plates said. I wrote it all down and we're gonna publish it into a book. Why would he make it up? Okay, fine. I bet he'll have no problem. Look, ah I'm sorry about losin' the pages we worked on, Joe, but I'm ready to write it all down again if you translate from the plates. He is?? Wow! If God got angry with you, then you must be tellin' the truth. All right, Martin. Let's get to work! Sir? Oh why? I guess I never thought about why, sir. We just do it. What what what? It says right here on the final sheet he is! It said on the final sheet! Sir, it's possible that he is black, even though he doesn't look it."
"MRS. HARRIS","Martin, how do you know he isn't just making stuff up and pretending he's translating off golden plates?"
"LUCY","All right, here. I'm gonna hide these pages.  If Joseph Smith really is translating off of golden plates, then he'll be able to do it again. But if Joseph Smith is making it all up, then the new translations will be different from these."
"VERNON","Don't smoke! Don't ever smoke! And what about abortion, and AIDS? Yeah. So butt out! Remember, kids, if you smoke, you could grow up to be a failure."

"ROB REINER","I don't understand it. I pushed a law for higher taxes on cigarettes, I lobbied to get images of cigarettes removed from movies and art, I forced smokers out of bars and parks, but still I get letters from parents saying their kids are doin' it.  Apparently, people still don't understand hwo bad smoking people is for them. Don't they know how dangerous it is to their health?  Don't they know the hazard of second-hand smoke? Yeah, that must be it.  The tobacco companies, with their millions of dollars and their slick desks and fancy buildings, they're the ones making music wanna smoke!  They're the ones hurting our nation's health! I will not stand by and see the children of America corrupted by those bastards!  This is war!! Damnit.  Butter!  Butter! Butter!!  Hello South Park!!  It is so nice to see an entire town come together to fight for good health! And I'm gonna help ya!  These poor innocent children have been seduced into smoking tobacco. So I say, ""We fight fire with fire!"" We're gonna use these children to bring the tobacco companies down! All right kids, here's what we're gonna do.  We're gonna sneak you into the tobacco company by saying you kids want a tour for a school paper.  Once you're nside, mm, mm, I'm gonna take photos and then we'll publish them, saying that the tobacco company invited you over to seduce you into smoking. Got it? Mm.  Uh, we're just leveling out the playing field.  The tobacco companies lie to you about the dangers of smoking. If we're gonna take them down, we've gotta lie right back!  Oh my God!  Excuse me! Would you mind putting that death stick out?! Isn't smoking illegal in bars here? Oh my God! What kind of backward hick state is this?! Well when I relax I just go to my vacation house in Hawaii! Yuh your vacation house in Mexico, then, whatever it is! Look, you are putting my life and these boys' lives in danger by smoking that in here! And I'm not gonna tolerate it! I will end smoking in bars in Colorado! There will be no more smoking here! All right boys, just do what I tell ya and we'll be able to sue this tobacco company for two billion dollars!  As soon as we get into the mani facility, I'll snap the photo of you kids, and we can all run out! Think you can handle it? Heh, great.  Okay, now watch yourselves, kids. These tobacco company people will do anything to get you hooked on smoking. They are liars and they are frauds! Yes. My name is Rita Poon. I called about my boys wanting a tour. Oh. Hello, Mr. Harris. Not if I were around, they wouldn't have. Oh, nothing! Please continue. Oh, here boys. Let me get your picture. Got it! Ha! You bastards are going down now! I'm not Rita Poon! I'm Rob Reiner! And you've just been Reinered! Come on boys, let's make our escape!  Don't you try and stop us! Hoh boy, that was great, kids. Hah, you see that? They got into your head. Now you kids can meet some good, decent people, the folks who work to get smoking banned! This is how we get rid of smokers. We go state to state and do things like, use bogus studies and make extensive commercials to get the public on our side and force cigarette smokers to stop! Here you go Bob.  This is Mr. Baffrey. He does all our Photoshop work.  Now, all we have to do is Photoshop cigarettes into your hands!  And bingo! When this hits the papers the tobacco company is screwed! Hahahaha! You kids need to understand something, okay? Sometimes lying is okay. Like, when you know what's good for people more than they do. What?!  God-damnit, what the hell is wrong with people in this state?! Well they want proof?! All right, we'll give them proof! Boys, I need one of you to act in a commercial for us! We'll shoot it tomorrow! And you boys decide which one of you will be best for the part. All right people, we've gotta get moving on the bill to ban smoking in Potsdam! Let's go! Okay Eric, this is going to be real simple. All you gotta do is read the words on the TelePrompTer here. Let's see how the tobacco companies deal with this.  All right, roll camera. Roll the TelePrompTer. And whenever you're ready, Eric. And cut! Great! We got it! Wrap it up, people. That was fantastic. Eric, do you know what a hero is? A hero is somebody who sacrifices himself for the good of others. Youc an be a hero, Eric. All you have to do... is eat the cupcake. Hey! Give us the child! There, you see that?! The tobacco company won't give us the kid! And do you know why?! Because they know that if they give us that kid, then we'll kill him! And when our commercial goes on the air, it will lose them business! Yeah. When we kill the kid, people are gonna think it's because of second-hand smoke! And then these bastards are all gonna make money, and they know it! Oh, God-damnit, do I have to explain this again?! Smoking is bad, people! So if we have to be a little extreme to stop it, it's okay! GOD-DAMNIT THERE'LL BE NO MORE SMOKING!! I'm warning you: don't mess with anti-smoking groups! My goo! My precious goo!"
"BUDS MAN","Yes? But, uh, this is a bar. Look man, I work fourteen hours a day at the saw mill. I just got off work and I need to relax. I ain't got a vacation house in Hawaii! Yeah. Let smokers smoke."
"EXECUTIVE","Ah, yes, Mrs. Poon. My name's Kevin Harris and I'm the vice president of Big Tobacco."
"KEVIN HARRIS","Well, come on in.  How about a little history first?  Native Americans were the first to cultivate the tobacco plant. They smoked it in pipes for medicinal and ceremonial purposes. Escuse me? The first successful commercial crop of tobacco was cultivated in Virginia in 1612.  Within seven years it was one of the country's largest exports. That's right. Over the next few centuries the tobacco business was so great that many slaves were brought from Africa to help work the fields. And so for centuries, tobacco production flourished. Nobody was even aware of any dangers back then, until, in 1965, when Congress passed an act forcing all tobacco companies to put the Surgeon General's warning on their packages. So now, everyone knows the dangers of smoking. And some people still choose to do it, and we believe that's what being an American is all about. And here's our factory at work. Well, I guess that's the end of our tour. What?? Oh my God! We will not!"

"GOTH GIRL","My dad is such an asshole. Drunken bastard doesn't even know I exist. But then he won't let me go to the Skinny Puppy concert because my heroine-addict aunt is coming over for dinner.  Dinner? That's a laugh. Just an excuse for my mom to bitch at me for not wearing girly clothes like all the Britney Spears wannabes at this school.  GOTH GIRL Whoa. Make it ""I miss seeing you so much I wanna slash my eyes out with razor blades."""
"LITTLE GOTH","They're all a bunch of Nazi conformists cheerleaders. I'm not doin' it either. I'm the biggest nonconformist of all."
"MERCEDES","Okay, I know it's your first day, Ferrari, so I wanna go over the basics with you. First of all, there's a five foot rule. If you come within five feet of a customer, you need to acknowledge them, even if they're not at your table. ""Hey, cudie."" When you're not serving food or talking with customers, you need to dance around and have fun.  We use things like Hula Hoops, silly strings, and water guns to play with the other girls. Be sure to giggle a lot, and be sure to show off your raisins.  Now, when you take a customer's order, you need to sit down at the table with them and make them think you're interested. Write your name down for them and make them feel special. ""Oh man, I am so bored. Thank God you guys came in."" If you want good tips, the most important thing is physical contact. Just a simple hold of the arm can mean the difference between five and twenty dollars. ""I'll be right back with your order, guys."" Okay. Well, I guess we're ready to open for business. Good luck.  Go ahead and open for business, Porsche! Hi, welcome to Raisins. Three of you? Great.  Be sure to try our Cheddar Poppers. Right this way. Here you go. Porsche will by right with you. Wow, that sounds great. I always wanted to try my dancing somewhere else. Why not? Hey, we should get that kid that was state champion in tap dancing. I think his name was...  Leopold... Stotch or something? A tragedy? Yeah, you didn't tell us that we might get served. Stan. Stan, we have a big problem. It's Jeffy. He sprained his ankle. He was practicing the say takedown and slipped on the floor."
"FERRARI","Okay. Wow, thank you so much, Mercedes."
"HENRIETTA","Go away Mom! Leave me alone! You'd like to wait till I was dead, wouldn't you? You'd like to see maggots eat my face. Conformist bitch. For sure. Did she step on your heart with stiletto heels? Yeah. I'm not conforming to some dance-off regulations. Whoa. I think we just got put in our place."
"OTHER GOTHS","Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
"GOTH VOICE","Look at this. Another tortured soul. Another life of pain.  Hey Raven, check it out."
"THE BROFLOVSKIS","Sov, sov, sov! Sov, sov, sov! Ma nayim vi-tov."
"HARRY","My wife and I had a child a few years back, and, we weren't ready to have a child, so we put him up for adoption. We were told that you might be the- It was a tough time for us. It was a tough time for all of Canada. The whole country was devastated by the cola wars. It just seemed we couldn't take care of a baby. We want to take Peter home, to Canada. Changing your mind is a Canadian custom that we hold quite dear. And besides, the new Canadian Prime Minister has issued a decree that all adopted Canadians must be returned home. He doesn't belong here. He belongs in Canada with his own kind. Please, don't make things any harder for Peter. We're prepared to go to court! We had hoped it wouldn't come to that! Come on, Peter, we should get going. I have some chocolate. We're going to take good care of him. Young man, you... must really care for Peter to have come all this way. Peter, would you like to go back to your home in Colorado?"
"ELISE","Peter!  Oh God, Harry! It's our son! Peter, it's Mommy. So we put him up for adoption. But as the years passed, I, I just felt an emptiness in my heart.  Oh it's so good to see him. I don't think you understand. We didn't come to visit Peter, we came to take him back. Yes! Peter, you must come with Mommy and Daddy. Perhaps we were wrong to try and take Peter back. He doesn't belong here. He belongs with his family. Me neither. Oh honey, let's be good Christians from now on! Hello. Oh I agree. There are so many of us who are moved by The Passion. It's a perfect idea to have us organize so we can strengthen the Christian community. Wha, what does that mean, sweetie? Well, what does that mean, dear? Oh huh, this is fun! It has reaffirmed all of our faith in Christ."
"THE GINTSES","Yes!"
"CANADIAN MAN","Eh-xcuse me?  Uh, is this an invasion? Oh thank heavens! It's okay. Everyone, it's not an invasion!"
"CANADIANS","Welcome, friend, to Canada! Canada Friends loves you! His brother is our quest. The question is, is what? You must talk to the new Prime Minister if you think his brother's home's back there. It's Scott! AAAAHHHH! To go anywhere in Canada, you just follow the only road.

"MAN IN BARREL","God, what a dick!"

"ARTIST","Would you like a moustache? How can ze French not drink wine?? Travestie!"
"FISHERMAN","Not a-hire, Scott! I'm Steve the Newfoudlander. And you'er on Newfoundland property now! Get off before I have you arrested!"
"DOORMAN","Yes? Ha! Impossible! The new Prime Minister isn't seeing anybody! Yes? The Prime Minister isn't here. He's in China on official business. So you might as well go home. Good-bye! Oh please! Please stop crying. All right all right, I was lying. The Prime Minister IS here. Yes yes. Come in."
"PRIME MINISTER","I am the Prime Minister of Canada. What do you guys want? That is a great speech, guy. But the answer is no! All of my new laws will stay in effect forever! I SAID GO! I am the Prime Minister of Canada. I can do whatever I-  Uh oh. Uh, don't mind that guy hiding in the spider hole, he's just my friend."

Oh well, let's murder one of these other dogs."
"A BARKER","Now, this lamp comes from the estate of Edna and James Hollinger, who lived in upstate Wyoming.  It has a bronze finish and actual gold leaf along the base. Uh this is a rare opportunity to own a classic antique.  The lamp has been appraised by our auction staff at well over two thousand dollars. So we're gonna start the bidding at three hundre seventy five. Do I, do I hear three hundred and seventy five? Kid, what the hell do you think you're doin'?"

"BIG ATHLETE","Hey Jimmy."
"NATHAN","So uh, I see you train pretty hard. Wellll, maybe I can- help you out. You know, there are shortcuts. You know. Steroids. Yeah, sure, but these are new. They don't show up in our urine tests. You just take one of these little blue babies  three times a day  and inject this directly into your bloodstream twice a day before meals. Ahhh it isn't cheap. I've gotta keep vice off my back and secure shipments from overseas. Oh, whatever you say, Jimmy my friend. Whatever you say."
"NANCY","I was hoping we would study for the spelling test tomorrow. Jimmy, I thought we were meeting at the doughnut shop. I guess I didn't realize I was a waste of time. Jimmy, everyone's worried about you. You seem... different. You're not the boy I fell in love with last week during Free Period. I'm leaving you. You can't treat people like this!"
"COACH","All right, thirty yards, Timmy! Keep it up! Come on now, keep it tight!  Good. Now watch that timing, drill team! Not bad, kids. Not bad. All right, it was good. But we don't want ""good,"" we want pain! Yeah? Oh, so you're the father of the boy who's gonna get f'd in the a on Saturday? Oh, it's on! Whoo, it's on all right! It's on!

All right boys, now you're all here because you're the best of the best. I know that you've all worked really hard to make it this far, so let's get out there and  SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT! Uh, uh excuse me, Brof-Broflovski, is it? Can we talk to you for a minute?  You uh... You're the best player in your school, are ya? Yeah. Uh, look, kid, you've got great skills and a great attitude. But you're just not physically ...built for the game. Well, it's just that... Jew's can't play basketball.  Awwright, kids, we've gotta work on that shooting! Come on! Who are you? Well, you're tall and black enough. All right, Broflovski, suit up! Broflovski, be ready to take over for Owens. All right. Broflovski, you're going in next possession."
"VOLUNTEER","Yup. Just take the sign-up sheet down to the next table and we'll get it all finalized. Thank you! Good luck, Michael. Okay, next in line please? Hello there. Oh, great! What's his name? Okay. Age? O-kay, and what's his disability? ...Nno, I'm asking what his specific condition is. Down's Syndrome? Cerebral palsy? I'll just leave that blank for now."
"MICHAEL","Thanks. The child did something none of us could: Reach lever sixty on the PSP. Now I don't know if that's luck or perseverence, but it's Goddamned impressive. All right, Kenny, let me show you what we're up against.  This is the Kingdom of Heaven. Satan's armies will attack the gate ...here. They are... ten billion in number. Maybe more.  Our armies are here, here, and here. Just under... ten thousand strong.  We are outnumbered and in need of someone who can singlehandedly bring the whole Dark Empire down. Basically, Kenny, you... are Keanu Reeves. Up here, you get the best tactical view to protect the fortress. It is from here, Kenny, that you shall command the armies of heaven. This golden PSP is king of all PSPs. It works just like the ones we sent to Earth. All the commands you make will be sent to the troops down on the battlefield. All you have to do is play the game, Kenny. Only this time, It's for reals. Prepare the troops!  We must be ready for them!  The time is at hand, Kenny. The stage is set and the final battle between Heaven and Hell is about to begin! The fate of the outcome is in your hands.  Where'd he go? A feeding tube?! But... that's not natural. God intended Kenny to die! What are these people doing?! Oh God-damnit Are you stupid, Uriel? Japanese people don't have souls! Kenny remains our only hope! Here is what we must do.  Gabriel and Uriel, you go down to Earth and try to get that feeding tube removed. In the meantime we will put all our troops at Heaven's Gate. We will try to keep Hell's Aermy from breaking through as long as possible. Hopefull, it will be long enough to get our Keanu Reeves back. Send our troops to the battlefield! I'll command as best I can! Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Get him into the command station! Hurry!  Satan's army charges! Tell our troops what to do, Kenny!  So it begins.  Now we shall see the final battle between Heaven and Hell play out!  Yesss, good, Kenny! The angel spearmen are taking out their demon soulrippers! Oh, the cavalry angels are clashing with their Black Knights! Oh my God! My God, this battle is epic! Ohh, they're bringing in their demon dragons! Look at the size of them! My God, this is even bigger than the final battle in the Lord of the Rings movie! It's like, it's like TEN times bigger than that battle!"

"RABBI","Shalom hak nak shalom. And now one of our fine young shlokas, Kyle Broflovski, has asked if he could speak to the congragation. Now, now, everyone calm down. We live in a rational community, and everyone knows this is just a movie. There's no cause for alarm. This movie is causing anti-Semitism! You must remove it from your theater! This film is anti-Semitic and it must be stopped! It's made one of our little Jewish boys want to apologize for the death of Jesus!"

"TALL GOTH","Of course we know how to dance. Yeah.  The only cool way to dance is to keep your hands at your sides and your eyes looking at the ground. Then every three seconds you take a drag from your cigarette. I'm such a nonconformist that I'm not going to conform with the rest of you. Okay, I'll do it. We should go to the arcade. Yeah. There's this Asian kid name Yao. He's an expert at that Dance Dance Revolution game. He should be. He's here playing that game every single day after school. I think he's spent about six thousand dollars on it so far. Dude, we need a girl. We can't be a dance troupe with just guys. People will think we're fags. Hey dickhole! What do you think you're doing? No no nono no, I'm not gonna be in the talent show. That was killer. We showed them."
"RED GOTH","Dance troupe? Please.  We don't dance like those Britney and Justin wannabes at school.  Goth kids dance to express pain and suffering. No way. Dancing is something you do alone in your room at three in the morning. I'm not doin' it. Being in a dance group is totally conformist. Yeah. We just got Goth-served. Yeah, I hope we win."
"YAO","You mean, dancing without a machine telling you what to do? That's stupid. I can't dance without the machine. Okay. I'll give it a shot. Hey I heard about this guy in Cuomo who has a duck that can dance. That don't look like a dancing duck to me. What? I don't wanna get served. Can he move it?"

"MITCH","We're really smart. Yeah. Maybe that robot can be programmed to come up with movie ideas! Oh, very nice, Mitch. Yeah yeah! Yeah, we wanna hear it! Punch-Drunk Billionaire!"
"BLACK OFFICIAL","That's incredible! Yes, that might be the best thing to do. Jesus. It would be Pearl Harbor all over again. A robot with smelly farts? That doesn't make any sense."
"WHITE OFFICIAL","You're thinking the robot could be used to come up with anti-Islamic movies? Uh huh. I don't see how we have a choice. But worse. With robots. Jesus, the scientist was right."
"SCIENTIST","Hold on a second: If that robot is designed for entertainment, then, turning it into a weapon is unethical. I I'm sorry, I must protest. We, we have no data suggesting the Japanese have developed a robot with offensive capability. What the hell? It... powered itself back on. Are your systems stable? Run a systems check on your CPU. Ah, I'm sorry, robot,  they want me to reprogram you. What did you say? ...Oh my God. The robot... It thinks it's alive. It's developed consciousness. Must be a malfunction of its exographical IMS or the... interlaced BV system. Your robot doesn't know it's a robot! Sure, why not? Program the memories of some eight-year-old boy who doesn't exist, and make the robot think he's real! Makes for a lot better movies! I'm not reprogramming a robot that's developed consciousness! Damn you all to hell!.. Hang on! I'm getting you out of here, robot! Well I, I'm saving a conscious being! If you wanna kill it, you'll have to go through me!"

I have a half-brother and a half-sister. But they live with their mom now. I don't have a mom. No. I was made in a laboratory. My daddy wanted to have a baby, so he put me in a test tube. Then, they put me in a woman's tummy, and, when I was born, Daddy took me home. Noo... But I used to have a lot of bodyguards and nannies, if that counts. Wow, these are great. What are they called again? Nah, I'm not supposed to. Dad says I have to keep my face hidden. Hi Stan. Dad says it wants to eat us. We're scared! Hi guys! Really? You mean it? Aaaaaah!! Aaaaaaaa!

"FRAKES","Placing pubic hair from the raped girl now, sir."
"YEATS","Does that look like a black guy to you?! Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! We could have made an innocent man go to jail who wasn't black! Oh!  Wuuugh! Wuugh! Ohaugh. Ugh.  Jesus, Harris. What are we becoming? We're supposed to... protect the people. Where have we lost our way? To hell with you!! I'm never gonna frame an innocent man again! Unless I KNOW he's black for sure!! I'm givin' up, Maggie. I'm quitting the force. None of it makes sense anymore.  I don't even know if what we're doing is right. The last thirteen hours we've been working on a case, trying to get a real scumbag off the streets. And when he walked up to the door, I could have sworn he was white. Maybe I can't tell the difference anymore. Maybe it doesn't matter. Because it seems like every time we frame a rich black guy, he's back out on the streets in no time. It's just like OJ. Do you know how hard those cops worked to frame him? The tireless hours they put in?? And then he just gets off because somebody messed up and said the N word out loud too many times. I guess I'm just tired. I'm jast damn tired. And you're a good wife, Maggie. You know me better than I know myself. Think I've got a little more work to do. Hello, this is Sergeant Yeats over at the Park County Police Department in Colorado. Well, we've been trying to frame this guy who just moved into our town, and the fil-o-fax says he moved from yoru area. One Martin Jefferson? Well, he doesn't really look that black. You say he disappeared? What did you frame him for? Molestation, nice. That's damn fine police work, sergeant. Damn fine. Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! It must be the same guy! Freeze, Jefferson! The gig is up! You are wanted for child mo-les-tation! Well, if you're gonna give away all your money, then, I guess we can drop all those charges. No point in putting another poor black man in jail."
"MAGGIE","Quitting the force? You? Not another word of that kind of talk, Harrison Yeats.  Believe me I would love nothin' more than to have you quit the force and no longer have to worry about whether or not you're comin' home. But I know you. Framin' rich black men for crimes they didn't commit is in your blood. Wipin' that rich, smug smile off their faces is the only thing that puts a smile on yours. You're a good cop, Harrsion Yeats. You don't have to question that. Because I'm here to tell you. Where're you goin'?"
"SNETZL","Santa Barbara Police Department, this is Snetzl. Yes, sergeant. What can I do for you? Hm. No, we never had a any rich African-Americans named Jefferson here. If we had, we would have framed him ourselves. Yeah, I don't uh... Hold on a second. There was oine we framed a couple of times, but the black bastard was so rich he made bail and disappeared before the trial. We uhhh found some kids that had stayed over at his place, and we asked them to lie and make up some false molestation charges. Yeah, it was a lot of work. Took years, but we were finally able to arrest him. Then we planted some evidence, took embarassing photos of his penis, and threw him in a dirty prison cell with doodie feces on the walls. You should have seen him squirm! Heh yeah, but the point is this guy didn't really look black either. We had to sneak in while he was asleep and get a DNA sample to be sure."

"AARON BROWN","Incredible, absolutely amazing news today. A man from the future has come back in time and is in a government hospital after being hit by a car. Christina Naylon has more. Have to interrupt you there, Christina. Apparently, Brad Morgan is inside the base with breaking news. Brad? Heheh, it's absolutely astounding. He came back here for work? And now I understand we're going to Harrison Moore, uh, for an explanation on how the time portal works. Harrison? If you're just joining us, a man from over two thousand years into the future has come through a one-way time portal looking for work. Uh, the President is expected to give an announcement at any time. Still more immigrants from the future arrived at the time border today, some even bringing their entire families. the purplish goo that they have on their bodies when they arrive is an ectoplasmic side effect of the time-travel process. This is all giving scientists a great opportunity to learn even more about American life in the future. Chris Holt joins us now. Chris? Apparently the people from the future are having a pretty easy time finding work. Since they offer to work for such low wages, they're being hired all over America. Breaking news at the time border. We go now live to Harrison Moore."
"CHRISTINA NAYLON","The news is incredible, Aaron. Experts and scientists have been with the man from the future for several hours now, and have been able to learn that he is from the year 3045. His condition is stable, and speculation continues as to why he has come. Has he come to deliver a cure for cancer? Or to fix something wrong with the past?"
"BRAD MORGAN","Aaron, the scientists have been able to communicate further and have uncovered that the man from one thousand years in the future has come to our time... looking for work. Now, uh he has said that the future is so overwhelmingly overpopulated that there are simply no jobs in his time, and so he built a time portal and has come back to 21st century America, uh to find a job here. Huh... that's right, Aaron. Hi-his plan is to get a job here, in our time, so that he can put the money he earns into a savings account, uh, which will earn interest, and by the year 3045 be worth billions of dollars, uh which of course in the future will be worth only hundres of dollars, but uh enough, he says, to feed his family."
"HARRISON MOORE","Aaron, I'm standing at the time border which scientists say follow Terminator rules. That is, it's one way only and you can't go back. This is in contrast, say, to Back To The Future rules, where back and forth is possible, and of course, Timerider rules, which are just plain silly. Anyway, it appears that the man from the future is here to stay. Breaking news here at the time portal, Aaron. It appears that another person from the future has just arrived!  It looks as if the job at Wendy's did work for the original immigrant; this second arrivee claims that man's family is now much better off, and wishes the same for his family. Aaron, I'm standing at the time border where some kind of mass protest has broken out.  Hundreds of men who have lost their jobs to time immigrants are here having sex with one another.  These men have apparently sucked and screwed their way across the state and are now here at the time border trying to get national attention. These unemployed men have been having sex for several days. Joining me is their spokesperson, Randy Marsh.  Mr. Marsh, what exactly are you trying to accomplish? Do you really think you can get enough people to turn gay to destroy the future of humanity? Young man, what do you think about all this?"
"MRS. LANDIS","Ooo, oh dear, I'm sorry boys, but I've already hired someone else to do it. One of those immigrants from the future. He said he would do it for twenty-five cents."
"CHRIS HOLT","Yes, there are incredible things we're learning about Americans in the future, Aaron. Eh it appears that in the future, Americans have evolved into a hairless uniform mix of all races. They are all one color, which is a yellowy light-brownish whitish color. Uh it seems race is no longer an issue in the future, because all ethnicities have mixed into one. Perhaps most interesting is how this has affected their language. The people in the future speak a complete mix of English, Chinese, Turkish and, indeed, all world languages, which sounds something like this:  Back to you, Aaron."
"DARRYL WEATHERS","Thanks for having me, Bill. You're Goddamned right! These people from the future are takin' all the work away from us decent present-day Americans! They took our jobs! Those jobs belong to people from the present! They took our jobs! Listen up, everybody! We've just received a reply from our congressman.  ""Dear intolerant rednecks, we sympathize with you all losing your jobs. However, we feel your solution of shooting everyone who crosses the time border is inhumane."" So it appears the government ain't gonna help us! Which means we gotta take matters into our own hands! The only way to stop people from the future is to stop the future from happening! All right! So, any ideas how we can stop the future from happening? How the hell is global warming gonna cause an ice age?! Chet, you are a fuckin' retard, you know that?! Even if global warming were real, which all proven scientific data shows it isn't, it would take millions of years for a climate shift to happen! You think an ice age can just happen all of a sudden-like? Well help yourself to a fuckin' science book, 'cause you're talkin' like a fuckin' retard! Now, come on people, we've got to think! Damnit, they took our jaorbs! Come on, people, think! How are we gonna stop these immigrants from takin' our jobs! Hey yeah. Well that's not a bad idea! Think about it: These people are from the future, right? Well, if we can git everyone to turn queer, then there won't be no children to have no children, and the people from the future won't exist to take our jobs! You have to, Jimbo, or else we won't be able to stop them! They too 'r jaobs! Let's go over to that part of town that all the future people moved into and start humpin' each other until they disappear! Come on!  Come on! You want your jobs back or not?! All right, you future bastards! Think you can take our jubs?! Well, we'll show you! Come'ere, Earl!.  How do you like that, gooback?!  Come on, you guys! Everyone who believes in America, join in with us! We're gonna make these future bastards nonexistent! Yeah America! The immigrants are fadin' away!"
"DOUCHE","Hello. Heh it's typical for conservatives rednecks like these to view the immigrants as the problem, heh, but really, the problem is America. It is our greedy multinational corporations that keep everyone else in poverty. Your ancestors came to America as immigrants. What right do you have to turn these people away? Hey now, these immigrants have a right to retain their culture. Who are we to say our language is best? They deserve to have an education just as much as you do. You betcha. Trying to stop immigration is intolerant and ignorant. Those immigrants have a right to pursue happiness."

"MAN D","That was a good idea!"
"CHET","How about we cause more global warming, so that in the future, the polar ice caps melt, and and it ushers in a new ice age? Well you know, the... global warming could bring on like a climate shift or somethin'? Well I was just tryin' to be helpful. Did you say ""get gay""?"
"BOSS","You'll find all the copiers and printers in the next room over and then uh-"
"MR. NELSON","Oh... R-Randy... Uh I'm surprised to see you here. Ooohh boy, didn't you get my phone message? Ooo, this is awkward. Well, the thing is, Randy, you've been- replaced. Well we found an immigrant from the future who knows geology and he offered to work for next to nothing. Uh, this is Mr. Glughgogawk. I'm... sssorry, Randy. It's just, with all the budget cuts and all, we'll give you some tmie to clean out your desk. Follow me, Mr. Glughgogawk. I'll show you to the copy room."

Jim, first of all I would like to thank you for monitoring this debate. And I would like to thank all of the students and their parents for coming. But I would hope that those students and their parents who question my qualities would simply look at my opponent. He is a turd sandwich ... No, sir, if you'll pardon me, you are in fact, the turd sandwich. ... Sir, you are a turd sandwich. Anyway, as I was saying, ahh... wait, I I forgot what I was saying."
"TURD SANDWICH","We've got spirit, yes we do! We are sandwiches filled with poo! Yeeaahhh! You're a turd sandwich. You're a turd sandwich. You're a turd sandwich. I I'm sorry, Jim. Ha. Wha-hat a douche. ... Uh you know, uh, my opponent wouldn't even know the answer to that question. If you ask him the same question, he would not answer it.  He would stand around and just babble on and on about nothing until he was finally saved by the buzzer sound."
"PUFF DADDY","Your friend Kyle said you don't understand the importance of voting. Apparently you haven't heard of my ""Vote or Die"" campaign. What you think it means, bitch! Rock the vote or else I'm gonna stick a knife through your eye. Get out there and vote or I will mother__ kill you. I like it when you vote, bitch! (bitch!) I slam my jimmy through your mouth roof (mouth roof) Now get your big ass in the pollin' booth. I said vote, bitch, or I'll f_____ kill you! You can't run from a .38, go ahead and try!

"BALDING MAN","You have a home here, friend. I don't know if you can stay. We'll have to ask Dr. Cornwallis. Come.  We don't normally allow outsiders. See, here we live in harmony with animals. They're not our pets but our fellow living beings. We work with the animals and try to live as they do.  We make friends with the animals. We coexist, and we... intermarry.  This is my wife, Janice.  The outside world looks down on a man marrying a llama, but our love knows no boundaries. And why not? Mark here has been with Kelly for three years now.  And Gary and Sally here have just managed to have a child together. Yes, life here is good and natural. But now that you know where our compound is, you'll either have to live with us, or be murdered. It's not up to you. You'll have to talk with Dr. Cornwallis.  What did he say? Excellent! Dr. Cornwallis is wise beyond his year. Here's your PETA shirt and a bumper sticker. Stan, I want to introduce you to my stepdaughter, Teresa.  She seems to have taken a liking to you.  And she's ovulating. Stan, some PETA members are growing concerned that maybe you don't love animals. You... don't belong here, Stan. You should return home. But, why on earth wouldn't you wanna vote? But Stan, don't you know, it's always between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. Nearly every election since the beginning of time has been between some douche and some turd. They're the only people who suck up enough to make it that far in politics. Janice, we shall die together in each other's arms!"
"JIM LEHRER","Welcome to the cable-access televised debate between a giant douche  and a turd sandwich  We'll start with Giant Douche. Sir, some students and parents are reluctant to have a... giant douche represent them. What do you say to those people? Ahh, Turd Sandwich, I will ask you not to speak out of turn. All right, Turd Sandwich, this next question is for you. How should South Park Elementary enforce its laws of conduct for young athletes during sporting events. Your time is up, Turd."
"MAN IN SHORTS","Aaaah!! He's wearing the skin of an animal!  Take that!  I... hope that teaches you a lesson about being hurt."

"WHISPERS","six nienty-nine, fifteen dollars, etc."
"JIM","Oh, sorry boys. I'm going out of business."
"MR. FARKLE","I can't compete with Wall*Mart's low prices. Everyone is shopping there now, and... well, I can make ends meet. I've got to sell the store and try to find another line of work. I appreciate your business, boys, but you'll have to try somewhere else in town."
"HARVEY BROWN","We... invented the Wall*Mart Super Center in 1987. The idea was simple: build a store for one-stop shopping where bulk purchases could keep prices incredibly low.  We didn't know what we were doing. In just four years, it was out of control. You don't stop it. There's nothing! Don't you understand?! Nothing can stop the Wall*Mart in your town! ...Unless...of course, you can find and destroy its heart. Every Wall*Mart has a heart, somewhere near the television department. Destroy the heart and you could reverse the entire process! Because the Wall*Mart stops you. Many have tried, kid. Union leaders, nature activists, even the best fair-trade lawyers tried to stop the Wall*Mart and now? They are Wall*Mart shoppers all. It won't work, don't you understand?! It isn't gonna stop until there's nothing but Wall*Mart left! Jesus, what did we do?? WHAT DID WE DO??  Boys!  Tell the world... Im sorry!"
"GRANDPA MARSH","Welcome to Wall*Mart."
"TRENT","Say Uncle! Say Uncle! What do you shitheads want?! Sure! I burn lots stuff. Do you fuckheads even know how to put out a fire? All right, fine. Put it out! They said they could put it out.

I gots business to take care of. Five years. It's been five long miserable years. Can you give me back my time? Huh? Can you do that?? Kindergarten, first grade, second? Can you give me that?? I'm gonna give you something you didn't give me: a five-second head-start. Four seconds! Three seconds! Can Kyle come out and play? Thank you, ma'am. I've been lookin' for you!  Firve years I've been waitin' for this day. You had five years to do that. And while I wasted away my time in prison you've been enjoying nice, normal lives! Don't tell me that! I heard about the things you've done! But there WERE no magical Christmas adventures or talking poo for me! I didn't get to fight a huge mechanized Barbra Streisand like you did! No accidental trips to Afghanistan for Trent Boyett! Look, just take your punishment! You deserve it! Let me have my retribution and it can be over with. You don't even know how to use that! Wow! No!

"MR. MERYL","Well, the students just aren't watching ya. Your rating was only a four this whole week. Four.  Four students watch your show. And meanwhile, Craig's show is getting a 57! O-hoh, it's brilliant! It's all just video footage of animals close-up with a wide angle lens. It's what the students want, and it's cheaper to make than yoru show. Just one person and a video camera. Craig is a genius. Uh sorry, kids. Kids don't care about the news, boys. It's boring. Kids wanna see animals, close-up, with a wide angle lens. I'm sorry, kids. Y-y-you should be proud of what you've done. It's just that it's kind of gay. Boys, first of all, I want to tell you how impressed I am with your ability to get more ratings. Your show beat Close-up Animals with a Wide Angle Lens by three viewers! Yes, but unfortunately, you got crushed in the ratings by Craig's new show. All the students love it. It's an incredible idea called Close-up Animals With a Wide Angle Lens... Wearing Hats. Take a look.  That Craig is a freakin' genius, I tell ya. He like... an idea machine. I'm afraid it's worse than that, boys. I'm gonna have to give you all F's in Extracurricular AV Class. You have to learn now how important ratings are! Yes.  And I guess your best wasn't good enough . Boys, I want to congratulate you on what is perhaps the finest piece of student television I've ever seen. Not only did you get all the students and myself off of couch medicine, but you got a 22 in the ratings! Oh yes, Craig. It appears that the ratings for your show are down significantly. You need to know how important ratings are, Craig, so, I'm going to suspend you from school and request that you have your testicles removed surgically. You boys are approved for twenty-seven new shows. I want you to come up with an even better idea than the cough medicine story. Get to it!"

I said I'll give you two hundred million dollars for it!  I'll write you a check for Mr. Biggles right now. What should we do, Mr. Biggles? I drank too much.  Oh my God, I'm so wasted! The room's all spinny. I'm... totally passing out. Eugh. Where am I? Ew! This room's all middle-class and small! Yay Mr. Biggles, you're mine forever! Smile Mr. Biggles! This time I have to get a picture of my new pet BEFORE anything happens. Mr. Biggles! Mr. Biggles, come back! You'd better help me find him! No Mr. Biggles, no money! Mr. Biggles!

"MR. TESTABURGER","Oh my God! Well this place is-! Oh my God!  Mrs. Polk, you're buying this stuff for your daughter?! Unpopular?! If she's not a whore?! But these are our girls! Oh, uh uh sure I, I can buy a purse. Nope. Wendy, I think they're right. You see, you have to believe in the rights of women. For too long they've had to live a double standard.  Oh yeah. I'm sorry I've been so chauvinistic, Wendy. From now on you can have whatever you want from this store, I'll help make you the stupidest, most spoiled whore of them all!"

"MR. STEVENS","The homosexual is right. From now on, Bebe, you're going to dress like a little girl."
"DR. KELS","I'm afraid that your son is... incredibly stupid. He thought he could fly with cardboard wings. The stupidity is so severe that it caused a fall, which has... put him into a deep coma. There's no telling. He may never recover. We'll just have to wait. And see. You're at the hospital, Eric. You've... been in a coma for some time. It's been two days. Nurse, you can remove his face-warmer now. Now, Eric, you've suffered massive head traume. Your road to recovery will be long and arduous. At least another two days. I'm sorry, detectives, there was nothing we could do. Yes, it was pretty severe. This is the young man here. He was in a coma for over sixteen hours. Of course. Nurse?"
"LOU","I've... heard cases where people suffering head trauma awaken to some psychic abilities. I know it's ridiculous , but I'm gonna explore every possibility I can.  Hello, young man, could we have a quick word with you? Young man, how did you know the nurse was gonna walk in just now? Little boy...  Well it's a snowball's chance in hell but...  we were wondering if you could come down and see if your... new powers could help us catch the killer. This is... where the body was found. Multiple stab wounds, just like all the others. Stand back, give him room!  Come on, kid, concentrate! What do you see in your mind? Jesus Christ! Tom Johannsen, the owner of the ice cream shop! Mr. Johansen, could we have a quick word with you? Get him!  Code 6! Code 6! Congratulations, Eric. You just stopped the biggest killer in South Park history. His powers are uncanny. Take good care of him, Ms. Cartman. Make sure he uses his powers for good. There he is! Hey, Eric!  We've got a little problem. While the ice-cream store owner was in jail, another murder was commited. Which can only mean one thing! That a copycat killer is on the loose! We need your psychic abilities to catch this new guy right away! Whattaya got, wunderkind? Are ya seeing anything? I said quiet, you little brat, or I'll have you arrested for interfering with the law! Jesus Christ! Cause of death? So you're telling me somebody new is now copying the crimes of the copycat killer?! Jesus! Where will it end?! Every time I put a killer behind bars, another guy just steps in and takes his place! What am I doing wrong?! How do you know?? Are you psychic?? Look, kid, don't waste my time with your blood-sampling fingerprinty hocus-pocus! I have to find this new killer now! I owe it to that victim over there! I know she hadn't been in any recent episodes, but DAMNIT she deserved better than this! Come on, Murph, we've gotta talk to Eric Cartman again! Damnit! Damnit all to hell! They just found another body! That means a fifth copycat killer is on the loose! Where's my psychic?!"
"FEMALE DETECTIVE","All right, make sure you get pictures of everything in this crime scene. Sorry, Sarge, the psychic's mom says her son hasn't been home for a couple of hours."
"MR. JOHANSEN","Yes? Oh, hello, detectives. Wuhsure, come on in.  I'm afraid the house is a little bit of a disaster area since I have Why? Why??"
"WEIRD MAN","They're never gonna catch the serial killer. He's too smart. Do you want to see my cotton panties? ""Junior, what are you doing out?"" I'm sorry, Mother. ""You come home rigtht now and have sex with me!"" No, Mommy! You, you give everyone else credit for my work, because you fail to see my greatness. Because of you, nobody knows the extent of my deeds. You are obviously a big fan of my work. But I am the serial killer! The one whose rightful place in history you have smirched! And now you will have a place of honor, as my nineteenth victim. Before you die, let me show you the things that I've done, so you will understand the breadth of my transformation!  This... is me at the grand canyon.  Do you see? This is me at Mount Rushmore  Do you see? Do you see?? Here I am at the Alamo in San Antonio. This was just outside of the gift shop. Do you see??"
"JIM BROWN","The copycat killer of the cut-off-the-left-hand killer has been arrested. Police used the help of Eric Cartman, a wunderkind psychic detective. At the crime scene, the young psychic had visions flash before his mind, and the police immiedately arrested the owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The young man's visions were so astounding that other police departments have sought out his help. Multiple arrests were made today for the murder of Hillary Neals. Police raided the South Park Motel 6 at 4 a.m., where seven psychic detectives were staying.  The psychic detectives' horrible crime was found out by psychic detective Eric Cartman , who is now the only psychic not behind bars. What an amazing coincidence."
"OTHER PSYCHICS","Yeah!"
"SGT. LOU","Let's go! Doctor, could you remove his face warmer? We'd like to speak with him. Young man, the doctor said you've had some... visions about our newest murder? What do you think, Mitch? All right, we'll check this Deets guy out. But let's use that one thing that we never use. You know, what's that one thing that starts with an R that we never use? Yeah yeah, restraint. We'll check this guy out, but let's use some restraint. Good evening, sir. We're Park County detectives. We were just wondering if we could take a quick look around your house, Misterrr... Well Mr. God, it won't take but a second; it might help us with an investigation. I see you like cutting the eyes out of photos of women. My son is a big fan of that too. Jesus H.... That boy was right! Arrest that guy!  Whoawhoawaitwaitheywait wait yo! Oh wait a minute, no ah, I'm wrong. This isn't the guy. The serial killer always cuts off the victims' left hands. Well those aren't left hands.  See, on your left hand, the thumb faces to the left. Those are all right hands. Nope, this isn't our man.  We're sorry, Mr. God. It appears we've wasted your time. Yeah... Amazing coincidence... Call it police intuition, but sonethin' in there just didn't feel right.  Wait a minute. I'm not sure. I'm gonna have to run some tests. Murphy, do you remember what I was supposed to be doing? Oh right! The hands! Right! Oh my God. Murphy!  You're not gonna believe this. Hold it right there, killer! Well young man, you did an amazing thing. Not only did your psychic visions help us catch the killer, but a lot of innocent people are out of jail. It must be true. The kid is psychic. But I don't suppose it really matters much. Because in the end, the way I"
"MR. DEETS","Look! Look at the things I've done! Here I am at Yellowstone National Park! Do you see?! Here are pictures of my trip to Cheyenne for Frontier Days. Do you see?! God. That's it, no more pictures.  Time to die. Your hand will be one with the others."
"FEMALE PSYCHIC","Yes, thanks."
"WOODLAND CRITTERS","It's almost time when the time is here, It's almost time when the time is here,"
"RABBITY","Well hello there. Welcome to our forest. What are we gonna do? Can you do it, Stan. Can you build us a manger? Huh? Gee whiz, if it isn't the nicest manger I ever saw. I guess that means our Savior is gonna be made into Savior stew. Yay! Sacrifice me to the Devil!"
"SKUNKY","How do you like our Christmas tree? Porcupiney is pregnant! How delightful! I'm not c-c-comin' out. And you got rid o'her. Gee, he looks sad. Now all we have to do is put the Antichrist into our human host. Let's eat his flesh! Death and pain await all living things."
"BEAVERY","Why, it's the most perfect tree in the forest! How would you like to sing and dance with us for a while? Goo, goodbye Stanny! Let's face it. The mountain lion will never let our Savior be born. Well, it's been much too long now. Uh I'm afraid our helpful friend Stanny must be very dead. Are you sure. You've done us a huge favor, Stanny! Without the mountain lion around, the Lady Porcupiney can give birth to the Antichrist! Hey, look everyone! It's our old pal, Stanny. We figured you'd be perfect! To stop us? How come you're all alone on Christmas Eve. You've got to come with us! Guys, we did it! Oh. Hiya, Stanny! Wwow, look, there's Santa Claus!"
"MOUSEY","Oh no, I see a problem. Our Christmas tree doesn't have a star. I deduce the man-boy doesn't understand the seriousness of the fertilization. So soon! I deduce it shall serve as a perfectly suitable resting place, for the Son of our Lord. I deduce it is. Stanny, you're alive. The human must be non-baptized and heathenistic against Christ."
"DEERY","What is it, Mousey? Porcupiney is a virgin, Stanny. Her conception was immaculate. For real and for true? Well, think about it: You really think God would have sex with a porcupine? Yeah. We've got a big problem. Oh dear, maybe we won't have a critters C-Christmas after all. You're perfect! Just pu-perfect!"
"CRITTERS","Ohhhh Can you really? Oh would you please? Could you help us? Yay!! Ohhhh Goodbye, Stanny! Bye! Cya! I'll buy your hat! Hi, Stanny! Awwww. The mountain lion! Hide! Awwww. Awwww. Stanny! Hail Satan! Yaaay Satan! Yay, blood orgy! Blood orgy, yay! What special time and special day, Yay! Awwwww. Yay! It's almost time when the time is here, Hi there! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Woohoo! Woohoohoo! Let's go! All right! Woohoo! Yay! Aaaaah!"
"BEARY","We can't have a tree with no star on it. It's the nicest star I ever saw. But we got to have a manger. You all right, Lady Porcupiney? But, does that mean you killed the mountain lion? But we got to have a human host body for the Antichrist. But gee whiz, Stan, if you try to stop us, we'd have to use our evil satanic powers on ya. Oh boy! Our satanic powers sure did the trick! Oh look. That little feller is all alone. But does that mean you aren't baptized? Gee whiz, Santa, you're not gonna kill me, are you-"
"SQUIRRELY","Now don't be down, y'all. Maybe our new friend can help us find a star. You aren't gonna believe what happened, Stanny. It's the most magical Christmas gift ever! There's just one problem: We don't have a manger for our Savior to be born in. This is going to be the best critter Christmas ever! Is it gone? Every Christmas the mountain lion comes down and eats the virgin critter impregnated with the Son of our Lord. Hey, we shouldn't be upset this Christmas. We've got Stanny! He did it! Now our critter Christmas can finally happen! Hail Satan! Yeah, to the Son of our Lord, Satan, Prince of Darkness. Blood orgy!!! Hail Satan. The Great Satan has commanded that when the Antichrist is born, we must find a human host body to transfer it into. Now don't be down, y'all. Stanny can help us find non-baptized heathen human. Sorry Stanny, but you see, nothing can stop the birth of the Antichrist, except for a mountain lion. Hail Satan. The critter Antichrist is born, bringin' a thousand years of darkness to the forest."
"FOXY","She's gonna give birth to our Lord and Savior. Well, this is the end. The mountain lion obviously knows Porcupiney is pregnant, and he's gonna kill it again. Yep, the mountain lion probably swallowed him whole. This just calls for a celebration! Let's sacrifice Rabbity and eat his flesh!"
"PORCUPINEY","It has been foretold unto me that I would give birth on Christmas Day. My Son will have the nicest bed in all the forest. Oh dear, I'm so very afraid. Christmas is saved! Oooo. Oh yes, just felt a little kick is all."
"WOODPECKERY","Our souls are saved! Fit for a king! Oh boy, Stanny. You came just in time!"
"RACCOONY","Does this mean we can go to sleep now? Of course! Stanny can do anything! If he can build a manger, he can stop that mean ol' mountain lion! Aww, but why? We finally did it, Santa! We brought forth the Antichrist with help from our good friend, Stanny."
"MIDDLE CUB","Mommy? Mommy!  W... wake up, Mommy, wake up!"
"PALE CUB","Don't leave us, Mommy.  Man-boy, why? Why did you kill our mommy? Why?"
"DARK CUB","Oh no, it's the man-boy who killed Mommy! Yeah, better this than the slow death we'd face without a mother around. Yeah, and you killed her. And a dead mom. What? You mean like in an abortion? Do you know some place we can learn, mister? Sure. We know how to give abortions now. But Santa, what do we do about the Antichrist?"
"MEDIUM CUB","He's come to kill us now. You got tricked by a squirrel? Gee, you're not too smart, are you, mister? And our baby claws. But, we don't know how to give abortions."
"LIGHT CUB","It's okay. I died inside when Mommy was killed anyways. Us? No, we're just kids. We still have our baby teeth. Yeah. An abortion. That can work."
"MOTHER LION","Weh, ah my, what happened?"
"A CUB","Mommy?"
"THE CUBS","Yay! You're back! We missed you, Mommy!"
"DR. BIBER","Now, you're absolutely sure you want a vaginoplasty? All right, then let's begin.  Just relax, Mr. Garrison. I think if more people could just see a sex-change operation, they would know how perfectly natural it is. The first thing I'm going to do is slice your balls. With the scrotum open, I can now discard of your testicles. Now, I'll just continue the incision up the shaft of the penis. Now I'll just... turn your... penis inside out. All we need to do now is ...stuff the ...unskinned penis inside your... pelvis... And now I'll use the skin from your penis to make vaginal lips. Pretty much. So, I hear you're interested in reconstructive surgery. Oh yes, Mr. Garrison. Uh yes, he had a vaginoplasty. Mhm. Sure. You see sometimes a woman wants to be a man. That procedure is called a peniplasty. ...You what? Ohhhhh! You want a negroplasty! It's a fairly common procedure, really, just the reverse of a caucasioplasty just like Michael Jackson had. Let's take a look here.  What we do is slice your face and peel it back so we can insert now pig-ment producing cells inside.  We break the arm bones in several places and put braces to make them longer. Now, the knees we need to snap off and fill with small round objects that can cause better movement.  And we finish it off with a nice peniplasty to enhance the genitalia.  Negroplasty takes about seven hours and costs roughly three thousand dollars. Well, it's a good idea if you wanna be tall and black. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it. Dr. Biber. Oh, you're Kyle's father. What is that on your shirt? Ahhh you like dolphins, hm? I can make you one. Invert the back, move the esophagus to the top of the head. Yes, a full dolphinoplasty could be achieved relatively simply... There's nothing crazy about a person wanting to look on the outside the way they feel on ths inside. Excuse me, I'm performing an operation here! I gave you a sex change. Mr. Garrison, I can't reattach your organs. Because I've already used your testicles to fashion new knees for a little boy who wanted to be tall and black. And your scrotum has been made into a dorsal fin for a man who wanted to look more like a dolphin. He's going to play basketball? Oh my God. Well, ah I only made him look like he could play basketball. If he actually does it, the testicle in his knees will explode! No, I just made him look more like one. We have to stop him from playing! Those testicles in his knees are ticking time balls! Come on, we've gotta get to those balls! I'm sorry, Kyle, I should have told you the surgery was cosmetic only."
"LEAD REFEREE","All students trying out for the All-State team to center court!"
"MRS. GARRISON","Hello everybody!  Can you believe it ladies? I'm one of YOU now!  Wow, just look at all these tampons! Regular, heave flow- Oh boy, I can't wait till I get my first period! Hi gals!  Oh boy, can you believe the sales they're havin' out there? Well, I'm about to pee out my vagina for the first time.  Give us a hug. Girls' Club! Oh wow! This is great! Look at that, I'm peeing sittin' down like a dainty dignified little woman!  Sany, any of you ladies wanna go see a sad movie together?  You guys try those new wings tampons? Do those work well? Hello, boys! It's me, your teacher! Mrs. Garrison! I had a sex-chamge operation. My penis is now a vagina and I'm experiencing womanhood for the first time in my life! See ya in class! Hello, Mr. Slave.  Boy have I been busy. A woman's work is never done.  I got some tampons. I should be getting my period really soon. I hope I don't get too emotional and drive you crazy with my PMS.  Mr. Slave, I got somethin' for us, too.  Would you like to take this beautiful woman to bed? Nu- no thanks? Come on, Mr. Slave, I wanna try out my new snootch. Well, I ASSUMED you supported me. It's still me; I just have a vagina instead of a penis. Don't you even care that I was suffering? I wasn't happy the way I was! Look, we can still be together. All you have to do is stop being gay! I'm not gay! I'm a woman! Oh, so is that it?!  You're just gonna walk out?! You men are all alike! Go ahead and find somebody who doesn't have a vagina, you fag! Oh jeez, should I do it?! Should I do it?! Oh what the hell!  Wooo! Huhuh, wooo! Look, I'll giggle and make them bounce up and down!  Heeheeheeheehee, heeheeheeheeheeheehee. Oh boy, men will do just about anything to get a look at our tits, won't they? Men are all the same. My boyfriend walked out on me! Turns out he was a fag. But I've been livin' it up ever since, havin' sex with all kinds of different guys! Girl power!  You know, the strange thing is, I haven't gotten my period yet. Is there a reason a woman might miss her period? ...Pregnant?  Oh my God. Of course. I haven't gotten to experience a period because... one of those truckers I slept with got me knocked up.  I'm pregnant, everybody! Hoh boy, now I can have an abortion! You here for an abortion too?  Yeah, I discovered a few days ago I wasn't bleedin' out my coo, so I guess I'm knocked up. Is this doctor any good? Oh, that's me. Hello doctor, looks like I need an abortion. Yeah, I've got one growing inside me. Now, are you gonna scramble its brains or just vacuum it out?  ...If you want you can just scramble it and I'll queef it out myself. Mrs. Garrison. Don't you tell me what I can and can't do with my body!  A woman has a right to choose! But I missed my period. You mean, I'll never know what it feels like to have a baby growing inside me and then scramble its brains and vacuum it out? But I paid five thousand dollars to be a woman. This would mean I I'm not really a woman. Ih, I'm just a... a I'm just a guy with a mutilated penis! ...Oh boy, do I feel like a jackass. Hey asshole! You told me you were going to make me into a woman! Yeah?! Well what kind of woman can't have abortions and bleed out her snatch once a month?! You made me into a FREAK is what you did! And I want you to change me back! Why the hell not?! You WHAT?! Oh you! You're comin' with me right now to find my ball and scrotum right now, Mr. Man! Boys, have you seen Kyle?! He's not at home. What? Oh Jesus! We've gotta get to my balls before Kyle hurts himself! We don't have tickets! Look, there's a boy with my balls in his knees and he's in serious danger! My scrotum!  That dolphin has my scrotum! Now let us in! Gerald, where's Kyle?! My balls are in his knees. If he jumps with them they'll explode! Which one is he?? NO!  My baaaallllssss. Godspeed! We did it! We did it! Token is going to sing in front of a huge audience at the Miss Colorado Pageant in Denver. And for doing it he's gonna be paid two hundred dollars. Now of course, as a woman, I'm a bit against those chauvinistic pageants, but I hope that you children take a moment today to congratulate Token for being so special. Just between us girls, nothin' gets my vadge wetter than a black man singing. Get your man-hands off of me! Don't worry, Jimmy. We're not laughing with you, we're laughing AT you. Welcome students and parents to the annual South Park Elementary Talent Show!  We have a lot of little talneted performers to get through, so the quicker you shut up, the quicker this will be over!  Okay, first up we have Billy Turner, from the third grade, who will be doing an alto sax solo. Okay, that was the Goth kids with ""Talent Shows Are For Fags"" Okay, very nice, Clark and Laura. Very nice.  Our next act is Butters, who will be singing a song Okay, thank you Butters, very nice, short and sweet. And now we have Eric Cartman, who will be doing select readings from the movie, Scarface. Okay, very nice, Ike, thank you. All right, children, it looks like we have no more contestants, which means, the Talent Show is over! Now we will tally up the judges' scores and find out which act they hated the least."

"DON","Mm, no. Uh, look, Token, there's some shows in LA we wanna book you on right away. If you come out to my limo we can talk everything through. Actually, our fountain is two stories tall. Come on, Token, we have a lot to talk about. Sorry kids, nature of the business, you know?  Do you like steak, Token? I know a great place for you locally."
"TONG LEADER","Mr. Ru Kim, it appears we have a problem. We smuggled your wife into the United States for you. You were to pay us ten thousand dollars for that service. Yet, we have yet to be paid. It's too late for that, Mr. Kim. Your wife is now our property. We're taking her to Los Angeles, where she will work in massage parlor.until she works off the debt. Where is she?! You're lying. Turn him around! You don't wanna tell us where she is? All right. Puh la! Ching ga wai pan! Tell us where to find her, Ru Kim! You have no choice. You thought you could run from us, did you? You see, Mrs. Kim, when you made a deal with us, you signed your life away. Yes, we help Chinese citizens sneak into the U.S., but when they get here, they become our slaves. It's an age-old business, and nobody has the guts to stop us. What the hell is that?! Go! Go! Enough!  I have a lot of respect for you boys finding your way in here. But you come any closer and I'll blow her brains out. This woman has a contract with us! We own her! Her life belongs to us! Perhaps... you're right. We spend all this time... mooching off the hopes and dreams of others, forgetting that they are human beings. I am tired of this business. It is a very dirty and perverse business. We quit too.  It's time for us to find another way to make money. From now on, all contracts we have on people are null and void. Yes, you were right, kids. Her voice is so beautiful.  To think we would have made it so nobody would ever hear her sing."
"CONTESTANT","Hey kid, what do you think you're doing? Yeah. So do we!"

Keep your army marching, my Lord. I will get that feeding tube put back in. I will do what we always do: Use the Republicans. Removing the feeding tube is murder, hughughughughughugh... Who are we to decide if Kenny should live or die? Who are we to decide if Kenny should live or die? It is God's will that he live! No no, you don't say that part. Patience, my Lord!"
"ANGELS","Hail the holy PSP."
"GABRIEL","Hell's army is departing! They head now for the Gates of Heaven. Yes. Apparently they're using machines to keep them alive. And Satan's armies are approaching. Then they will be here on the morrow. Without Kenny's soul here there will be nobody who can use the holy PSP. Here is the hospital The tube has been removed? Good. Now all we must do is pray nobody interferes with the child's death a second time. No! Nono, see, they were playing God when they put the feeding tube IN! Michael! Michael!  The humans finally did the right thing!"
"FEMALE NURSE","Doctor! Doctor, we have a pulse!"
"THE DOCTOR","Then that's it! We brought him back. Call the parents. They're going to be shocked to find out... their son is alive. It's the latest in electro-plastilical science. Your son's organs are all functioning again. I'm a-fraid he can't respond to you. You see, being dead for that long, most of Kenny's brain cells died from lack of oxygen. Your son is alive, but, in what we call a ""persistant meditative staute."" I'm afraid no. Brain cells cannot be repaied once dead. But his soul is still in here.  Almost... trapped in here, if you will. Kenny is the same as he ever was. It's just that, now, he's more like ...a tomato. A feeding tube. It pumps a nutrient paste directly into Kenny's stomache. With it we can actually keep Kenny the tomato alive for years. He can't responde to you, boys. Being dead for that long caused severe damage to his brain, But this just doesn't seem right. I'm afraid I've been given a court order to remove Kenny's feeding tube. I'm sorry. I have no choice."

"MRS. MCCOMRICK","He did? When?"
"URIEL","No! There is another. A Japanese boy did make it to level fifty-nine. Oh, right right, I'm sorry This is hopeless, Gabriel. We cannot interact with anything on Earth, how could we possibly get a feeding tube removed? Apparently, some blessed child has done our work for us. No! No, no boys! Aw Goddamnit! No! No, they're not killing him, they're letting him die!"

"BOTH SIDES","Yeah."

"REPORTER CHRIS","Oho, well, I'm sure some of the Denver kids' parents would disagree with you and your team- Oho, looks like we got some parental trash talking going on here. Mr. Marsh, any comments? Well, tension is certainly high here, but I guess everything will be decided on the playing field. Tom, the convicts were about to be arrested when they ran inside the Red Cross behind me, and threatened to kill all the workers inside. The violent men are demanding a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars cash. An incredible development here, Tom. Two little boys have fearlessly gone inside the Red Cross. Tom, an incredible story of courage. Two little boys, armed only with the weapon of confusion, managed to go in and save the Red Cross. Nobody seems to know who the boys are or where they went off to, but they are heroes."
"BAT DAD","Oh yeah! Oh yeah!  South Park is goin' down! Feel it comin'!  You ain't got a chance, South Park! Here we go, Denver, here we go! Huh, huh! Here we go, Denver! These South Park kids got nothin' on you! Let's go, Denver! Throw the ball to third, you idiots! He's runnin' home! All right, Denver! You're up to bat now! Come on, Denver! Get the lead out! Do not cross the Bat Daaad! Why don't you just go home, South Park? You can't beat Denver! You'd better shut your mouth before I shut it for you! Now for the finishing move! You're about to be Bat-Dadded! He's done for anyway."
"TOM NELSON","There ain't no way some little mountain kids can beat Denver. Not with my son on second base! Mr. Marsh?? Who wants to hear from a Mr. Marsh?!

"THIN PLUMBER","Apparently there was so much chicken skin in the system it just ruptured the insides."
"ERIC CARTMAN","I'm gonna make, make it right."
"PSYCHIC","Certainly. Come in.  Have a seat and tell me what it is you seek. Well, many times, the reason that the sould stays Earth-bound is because God is intending to use that soul for a divine purpose, to help prevent an impending tragic event. But now, you shouldn't think you're crazy, young man. I see ghosts all the time. Yes. When's the last time you saw yours? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"

"DOCTOR PAL","Hey Jimmy, I'm Doctor Pal. That's because I'm a doctor, but I'm also your pal. Are we cool? A lot of times parents call me in because I can relate to younger kids. I'm I'm down, I'm dope, you dig? Now, I understand you have some concerns about erections. ""Oops, can't say erection in front of the parents right. Oh God, I feel so weird"" huh? Jimmy, there's nothing weird about random erections. Almost every boy goes through a phase where his penis becomes hard... for no particular reason. It's just part of grwoing up. Growing up? Growing out is more like it. Tell you what, Mom and Dad, why don't you skidaddle for a tick and let us hipsters talk in privo. Jimmy, as you get older your body goes through a lot of changes. Certain hormones start to release as your whole reproductive system begins to awaken, and so, if you like, we can take off our shirts and kiss. Oh, hey, nothin', you see? See, that set you off on a different tangent, got you thinkin' a different way. That's what Doctor Pal is here to do.  Unless, of course, you think we should take off our shirts and kiss. Well then to hell with you, kid. You can just deal with your problems on your own."
"BERTHA","Okay, see you later, Jessie. Oh, hey Jimmy. What's goin' on? What?? No way! Jerk!"
"SHAWNA","Okay, Mom. Hi Jimmy. Thanks, Jimmy. Where are we going? You know that girl Sally Rauman at our school? I can't stand her. Really? Well, Kelligan bought the same purse and I was like, ""No WAY do I want it now!"" because who wants a purse that both their best friends have, right? And so- -I guess that's why I figured, ""Who needs friends like that?"" It's like I told Debbie: ""If you're gonna go out with my friends-"" ""And so if you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend."" You know, Jimmy, you are a great listener. Yeah. I mean, no other boys really communicate like you do. ...What???  I'm not doing that! Creep!"
"HO","You lookin' for a date?"
"PROSTITUTE","They call me Nut Gobbler."
"NUT GOBBLER","Huh?? You a cop? You got money? All right, you got a place to go? What are we doin' anyway? I can't eat too much, I'lve got an infected urinary tract. I've been pissin' blood for a week. Huh?  Well, that's it, I just pissed blood! So I have to stick a tampon up my peehole. Look, kid, what are you doin'?! You wanna get laid or not? Kid, I'm a hooker. You don't have to take me to dinner OR be nice to me. You paid me, so you get to do me. It's that simple. It's where the trick wanted to go, you bastard! Uh Jesus. Agh! Let go of my hair, you son of a bitch! Where are you taking me?! No! Please! Chewmoney! I'm sorry! Aaaah! Aah??  NO! No! Heelllp!!  Haaaaaaaaaa!! Please, Chewmoney! Don't do this! Serves you right, you son of a bitch!"
"ROMA","Welcome to Buca de Fagghecini for the authentic experienso Italiano. My name is Roma, and uhhh  Oh, it's so nice to see you again, Mr. Valmer. Oh right, pardone, segnore. I'll come back with some garlic bread mediterraneane."

This PIMP is tryin' to steal you away from me!  This is MY ho! You got a problem, bitch?! You're comin' home right now! I'm gonna kick your ass, ho! I'm gonna kill you, ho!"
"CHEWMONEY","You're already dead, ho! Fuck you, punk! Get your ass back in here, ho! Goddamn, this pimp just won't give up! You're gonna pay for this, bitch! I told you never to turn on me, ho! And what are you gonna do, huh?! I've got four feet on you AND a gun! What do you have?! What?! That's pretty good. Oh yeah. That's right, she is."
"CABBIE","Look out! Six dollars and twenty-four cents. Oh, thank you very much.  There you go. Have a good 'n."
"MOTORCYCLIST","Daww?"
"KID MAGICIAN","Tada!"
"GOBBLER","I can't believe you chased me all this way. You, you really care about me. That's good enough for me.  Take me to bed."
"MEPHESTO","Can I help you? Brilliant idea! Huge, elephant-sized pigs! Oh, that's an even better idea! Come on in! I'm so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering... It's thanks to the wonder of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger, disease, pollution, even war. I've created things that will change the world for the better -- (pointing) -- For instance, here is a monkey with four asses. And here, of course, is my four-assed ostrich, and my four-assed mongoose. Oh, well, I suppose so... Ah yes, over here -- Here I have rats spliced with ducks... And gorillas spliced with mosquitos. And here I have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunny fish!! And over here is swiss cheese spliced with chalk... And a beard. Oh... well I'm sorry children, but pig and elephant DNA just won't splice. Haven't you ever heard that song by Loverboy? ""Da'n Do-A, Pig and Elephant D-N-A Just Won't Splice?"". However maybe I could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours. You know it's amazing what we can do with a little blood sample these days. Hmm? What? Oh excuse me. Oh, pardon me, I tripped. Could I have some hair please? Beautiful! It's absolutely beautiful!! My son, I think we've finally done it! Ooh! How luscious! Our creature has come to fruition, boys! Oh my God! He only has one ass! He's of no use to me, I'll have to burn the room! Oh no, this entire experiment is turning out very bad. Egads!! He's out of control! We'll have to destroy him. He's too dangerous, son! Son! No!!! Oh, son! You've made a horrible mistake! You've put all the people of South Park in jeopardy! Oh thank Bhudda, I've found you boys. You must tell me, have you seen anything odd lately? No, no I said ""odd."" Sir! If making mutant animals spliced with humans is crazy, then... uh... never mind. I'm afraid there's been a bit of an incident at the ranch. You see, I've created a large, mutant clone of that little boy there, and he's broken free. He's terribly dangerous. His brain is identical to yours. I need you to help me find him! Boys, boys, I'm lusciously sorry for everything! No, son! This beast is a disgrace to genetic engineers everywhere. (to the Boys) Boys, I'm sorry I've caused you such inconvenience. I tried to play God and I failed -- All I've ever wanted was to genetically engineer something useful. (starting to weep) But I've failed. Perhaps we shouldn't be toying with God's creations. Perhaps we should just leave nature alone to it's simple one assed schematics. Mayor! We've got a very big problem!! You know, to provide food for the needy. Well, something went wrong, and the turkeys broke free, and the worst part is... They're REALLY pissed off! We have to stop them or they could destroy everything! Time is short!! They act just like normal turkeys, except they're evil. Somehow I don't think you're taking me seriously. I knew you were the only person who would listen to me, Chef. Look here, my microscope. Tell me what you see... Oh, whoops. NOW tell me what you see. Precisely. But look how rapidly its dividing. It means the turkeys are growing at an exponential rate. If we don't destroy them all... They'll take over the town. Maybe the WORLD!!! Sure. They're increasing in number!! Mayor, these are the vicious Turkeys I warned you about!! We need more than that! They'll only come back in increased numbers!! I tried to tell you but you didn't listen!! That's not important right now. (standing over the turkey carcasses) My God, what have we done? But all those poor turkeys... They're all dead! As horrible as they were, they felt like a part of me. Perhaps I shouldn't be toying with God's creations... Perhaps I should just -- Wait! Wait! I know a way to find out! At my laboratory! We can do DNA genetic testing! I'll take some of your blood, along with the blood of everyone here and we can determine who your father is!! Yes! Of course... I mean, that much testing will cost a pretty penny... but... Three thousand should cover it! Oh, never mind. Alright, from everyone's accounts, I have narrowed down Eric's possible father to the people in this room... Officer Barbrady, Chef, Jimbo, Mr. Garrison, Ned, Chief Running Water, Gerald BROVLOFSKI, Myself, my friend Kevin, or the 1989 Denver Broncos. The test results are in this envelope... Shall I open it? The father of Eric Cartman is INDEED someone in this room!! The father is... And now... To continue, the father is indeed someone in this room! Gentlemen, the father is... Where... Where am I? Oh, I'm sure it was my brother again. He tries to shoot me every month. I'm glad you all could come... I can finally reveal who the father of Eric Cartman is... But first, I want to thank Kenny McCormick for sacrificing his life... Alright, Alright, Alright. The father of Eric Cartman is... Say did anybody see that Terrance & Phillip special last month? Wasn't that just the funniest thing ever? Alright, as I said before, the father is somebody in this room... The father is -- MRS. CARTMAN!!!! Yes, it took quite a while for me to understand as well. You see, Mrs. Cartman is a hermaphrodite. Meaning that she has both male and female genitals. No, no, not exactly, but she did have a penis. The fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so Ms. Cartman's DNA match with Eric can only mean that SHE is his father. And she got another woman pregnant at the drunken barn dance. Well, that's that. Thank you all for playing. Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father isü¾ ¼ John Elway. Mayor, I think the boys may have stumbled onto something here. You see, Mayor, frozen links are often found: dinosaur eggs, woolly mammoths. This specimen could be a missing link  in our evolution. If I can unfreeze the body, and perform an autopsy, I could learn much about this creature's people and its time. Thank you, Mayor. Oh, and boys, I, I can't give you a reward for finding this creature, but if you'd like, I'll let you name him. Steve it is. Come on, Steve. We've got work to do. Unfreezing this body will be quite delicate work. We'll have to use the most advanced methods available. This is very exciting. He could be a Neanderthal. Or an Autralopithecus from the Paleolithic era.  Do you see that, Kevin? These clothes are from Eddie Bauer. I haven't seen anybody wear clothes from Eddie Bauer sinceü¾ ¼ 1996!  This is incredible! Think of all we can learn from this body! All that it can teach us! Let's just hope the press doesn't get wind of this right away. Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot of work to do.  But it is my opinion tha this man has been frozen in time for over 32 months!  Yes, it's true, although at this early stage we know very little about this man or the time from which he comes. That's it, Kevin. Now we can begin the autopsy. Ugh? What's this? That's impossible!  Do an EKG on him! My God, he really is alive. The ice must have preserved him! Nono, we've got to think this through. Mayor, this man has not been conscious for almost three years. He won't understand what he sees! He'll be frightened and confused! Perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time. Oh my God. It looks as if he's about to speak! What? You're, you're hungry? You're, you're hungry? Me friend. Friieend. Me friend. Ma-phes-to. Mah-phehs-to. Hawgh! If we could understand what he's saying, then maybe we could get some answers.  If only there was someone who could communicate with him on a level as primitive as his own, a mind likeü¾ ¼ a child. Steve. You- Steeve. Steeeve. Steeeve.  Oh good, you're here. Yes, and I need you to communicate with him. See if you can understand what he's saying. What'd he say? Very interesting. What?? Tell him, tell him he'sü¾ ¼ home. In the year 1999. He's been frozen for the last 32 months. And we found you- All right, all right, all- All right, all right, calm down. I think that's enough for today. The same. That's right. Oh? Where are you gents from? Well, there's not a lot to see, butü¾ ¼ Come in.  He's still not responding much to us; the shock is still settling in,  but we've made great progress now that he's in the habitat. Yes. Kevin and I designed a habitat for Steve to live in that is completely like his own world. Everything is 1996-oriented. Yes, well, Kevin has done a lot of work in figuring out just how related to us Steve really is. Hew came up with this drawing How would we do that? As you can see, the ice man is listening to Ace of Base, which was a very popular group during his era, and primitive drummings soothed his people's tempers. Ah! Here we see the ice man trying to gain Internet access on the computer. The Internet was still not very big in his time, so the Web frightens and confuses him.  It's okay, he can't hurt you.  It's one-way glass: he can't even see us.  And now the ice man watches television. Wait. This could be dangerous. He's fine, boys. And we're learning so much from him. He's gone! The ice man has broken out! He must have used thisü¾ ¼ door We have to find him! He won't survive long out in the world! What? No, what did you say? Uh, use him for what? I have no idea! Was the ice man here? He can't function out here in our time! Is it him? Does he always do this? Have you seen a man who looks similar to us, but with a thicker brow and an apish nose? An ice man, a man from the past. We must find him. Now, where is he?! Where is he? Where is Steve?! We've got to stop it! He has to be around here somewhere. No! Come back! You can't get out! You'll never live! What?! No! No, this can't be! Fixed! Fixed! That was supposed to be my award, Kevin. I'll get him for this. Mark my words. I've managed to artificially inseminate Hope with your semen. Yes, yes, that's... very funny, Jakov. I... will need to examine Hope once more to see if the process worked. Yes! Yes, I think it worked!  You are going to be parents! Hello, NAMBLA members. As the South Park representative- What's going on? What children? Yes. What? No!  We're the North American Marlon Brando Look-Alikes. Don't tell me that that other NAMBLA is actually in South Park?! Thank you. Now, let's go get those othe NAMBLA bastards before they hurt any of South Park's children! Alright, Marlon Brandos, they've got to be here somewhere. Let's try this room. I think the boys went in here. No! You've got the wrong NAMBLA again!"
"MS. CARTMAN","Hello? Oh yes, Sharon. How are you? Hu-old on, dear, let me check.  Hon, I made beefy logs.  I made Cookie Dings. No, he's not here. Oh, dear! Ah-are you okay, hon? Oh. Well. Wwould you like some beetles for breakfast? Mmmm. Mmmm. Beetles are good with ice cream. I guess it's much better to get it when you're young. Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chicken pox, just so I would get it. Don't scratch it, hon. No, hon. Here, I got you some calamine lotion. It'll make your itches go away. Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad. I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion. Just use a little bit of that stuff, hom. It has to last a while. Ooh, I have them somewhere else, boopiekins. What's that, Eric? Don't pick your nose, hon. Don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll win. Hello, everybody.  Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon. Thank you.  Don't pick your nose, hon. Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy. Oh wait, wait.  You've got a little eye booger, hon. Got it. How's the treehouse coming along, hon? Sorry, hon. Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare. Well, all right. Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night!  Eric? Are you out there in your clubhouse? Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends. Around six hours. Well, I've got an idea. We could sing. Over the meadow and through the woods, Ooo, careful hon. These roads are bumpy. Here we go, kids. We're crossing the state line into Nebraska. Wheat. The building block of your favorite foods, and, Nebraska's principal source of economic productivity. You see, when Nebraska first became- That shouldn't be a problem. Eric's Grandma is right near the mall. About another hour, hon. Now, Eric, let's try to get out of that grumpy mood before we get to Grandma's. Here we are. Hello everyone. Happy Holidays! These are Eric's friends: Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Boys, let me introduce you to the Cartman family. This is Uncle Stinky. Aunt Lisa, Cousin Fred, Cousin Alexandra , Fat Bob, Jimmy , and Great-Grandma Florence No, no, Florence. That's not Eric. Ooh, I'm sorry to hear that, Stanley. Here, Kyle. Will you hold Great-Grandma's catheter bag during dinner? Great-Grandma has a bladder problem. This helps her out. Eric, did you say 'hi' to your little cousin Elvin? Hi, Howard. Hello? Oh, why yes he did. I thought you were dead, Sharon. Stanley told me you had passed on. I'm glad to see that you're better. Oh, hello boys. Have you seen Eric around anywhere? Oh, all right. I was just at the store buying some apples. Yes. Apples.  Ahapples, get it? Stinky apples. See you, boys. Squeaker! You have to see the eye doctor, Eric. You're not fat, you're big-boned. There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor. Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not? Now, hon. Eric, you have a little visitor. Is that all right? I'll think about it, hon. Mommy's busy, boopie-kins. Go ahead, snookums. It's probably one of your little friends. Hmmm. That's nice, muffin. Oh, Eric dear. It's what's best. Eric, this is for the best. Eric, it's important for you to understand-. Eric.  The babysitter's here. Come on downstairs. I have to leave soon, Eric. Come down as soon as you're done. Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelley. All those other babysitters won't come back. Oh, that sounds fine. I'm going to a meteor shower party. The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator. Eric's nookie time is 9 o'clock sharp. If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here. And if he gets cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with him, and make sure he wipes good after he makes bears. Oh! And don't mind the cat. She's just being loud because she's in heat. Okay, muffin. Mommy's leaving now. You do what the babysitter tells you, okay? Be good. Come give Mommy Eskimo kisses! Eskimo kisses for Mom-my! Bye, kids. No no no no, that's impossible, hon. I told her: no visitors. This party is very loud, boopy-kins. You'll have to speak up. Not really, hon.  Mom has to go now! I'll be home in about an hour!  Oh! Oh, Mr. Mackey! Hi, kids. I'm home. Oh, what a party that was!  Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. Eric, your little friends are here. E-heric, it's only Halloween. I'm sorry, hon, Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, his big-boned. Eric, calm down. What is it, Eric? I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric. Can't it wait till tomorrow, hon? Alright! let's go. They're so strange. Where are they from? Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad. You have? Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron. Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow. This year is gonna be different. Look! I got you ""Hooked On Monkey Fonics."" It's a new way to learn how to read and spell. And it comes with everything you need to help win that speling bee. It says we just put the cassette into a tape player Hon, are you ready for some math problems? Oh, all right. Yes? Sure, hon. Eric, I got you a new history textbook. Why don't you come downstairs. Eric, please. We have to do some studying today. What is it, snookums? Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin. Don't say ""tits,"" Eric. Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest. But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving. Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night. No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight. Good night.  What do you have there, Eric? Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days. Oh. Eh-hello, Dr. Roberts? It's Ms. Cartman. Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried. About a hundred and twelve. Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste? O-oh, thank you. Freebie next week. Yes, Eric Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down.  Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month. I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later. No, honey. It's just- Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child. Eric! Eric, wait! Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend? Don't apologize to us, apologize to him! Oh my goodness. Oo, poopiekins? Yes. Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't have any side effects, does it? Alright. Oh my. Oh, don't they look precious? Eric, sshhhh. Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again? Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you. And don't get too close to Kyle. He looks like he might have the AIDS. Isn't that funny, sweetie? You have been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass. Boopie-kins.  It's time to stop preaching damnation to everyone, sweetie. Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered dougnut pancake surprise. What? Oh. Well,  alrighty then. I... don't think it worked. Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you. Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed. Now, hon! Twenty more minutes, and that's it. Eh yes, sweetie. Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself? Mommy's  expecting  some company. Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to have a ""talk"" with you. Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat. Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat. ...And it has basketball courts and tennis courts, and you can call Mommy any time you want.  Oh, sweetie-kins, don't be mad. I'm sure you're going to have a good time. And when you come back you'll be all healthy and thin. Yes. I'm afraid he's a little moody. Oh.  Well, goodbye, sweetie. Thanks for coming, everybody. Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the new Eric Cartman. Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his fat camp. I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some? We've learned to overcome it, son. You'll see. Ssshhh, pumpkin, it's almost over. No, sweetie, we have to tend to some of Grandma's business. In a minute, sweetie. This is important. A million dollars? Oh my. Are you sure this is what you want, sweetie? Do you see that, Sheila? The Williamses are shopping here. Sweetie, your friends are downstairs. They need to see you. They say it's an emergency. Yes, sweetie? What's that, my little man? Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop. Orf course I do. Sweetie, don't. I'm glad you're not that bad, poopsie-kins Oh, my little poopsie-kins gets into no-nos once in a while, but he's still my perfect little plumsy-kiddle Oh, he's such a cutie. Ooo, he loves playing with his Clyde Frog and Wellington Bear. Oh, I mean, sex and drugs. Oh, but my poor little poopsie must be getting so hungry. Maybe we should get them a little food. Oh, all right. Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby suffer That's nice, poopie. Oh, but I thought your teacher died. Oh. Well, I'll tell Eric. He's just down in the basement playing with his dolls. Sweetie. You have to get ready for school Yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back. You'll get over it, honey. What's going on? I heard an explosion. Bad, Eric, bad! Well, Sheila, we can't shelter our boys forever from these things. Maybe it's okay for them to see an adult film. Mee too. Be careful with my baby. You're going to be okay, baby. Is he going to be okay?? Doctor! Did you find out what's wrong with him? Why?? What's wrong with him?? Well what does he need? What can we do? It's going to be okay, baby. We're going to get you more time. He's looking a little better today. Oooh, what should I do? I'm playing roulette with my child's life!  Ooo wait, Hairspray is showing in New York, isn't it? Let's go there. Eric?  It must be his time. I think it's running out! It's too far and your parents want you back home. Hang in there, sweetie. We'll be there soon. Please, call me Liane. Oh dear. Get it down. Oh, baby, your time is back! Oh it's so good to have you acting like yourself again, sweetie. I thought you got it. He's an imspration to us all. Is he going to be all right, doctor?? Oh baby baby, you can't die. Whoa. Easy, Kyle. I know you're in a very dark place now, sweetie. But you must come toward the light! Come toward the light! What's the matter, sweetie? Oh dear. Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest. What is it, sweetie? Oooo, looks like the tooth fairy was extra-happy with youuu. Boys, you have a little visitor. Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty. Well you should've called Mommy. Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and I'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers? Eric, you've done a lot of horrible things in your life, but smoking? You're grounded for three weeks! Oh my goodness, I had no idea.  Are you okay, sweetie? That's a great idea, Chef. Yes, hon? What's that, hon? Oh... Nno, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for ...""special"" children. You are, hon, but... I don't think that's a very good idea. ...I'm sorry, Eric. The answer is No. Oh, a-a-all right, sweetie, I, I'll take you tomorrow. Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please. Eric Cartman He's nine. ...Um, he's retarded. Ohhh, oh. I'm not sure.  Sweetie, what is yoru condition? Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting? Oh, that's great, sweetie. Okay, hon. Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch. Eric has been having some emotional problems lately. Oh, well, I'm not sure. Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago. Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him. Yes, of course he can go. I'll bring some of clothes over. Oh my God! Eric! Eric,  Mommy's here. Sweetie?  Oh what's wrong with him? Coma... My God, for- for how long? Oh my... Doctor!  He's awake! Oh, you've finally come back! It's a miracle! You're doing so much better, muffin. Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again. His new... powers? Oh he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy. Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you. Ah, no, these people claim that they are the ""real"" psychic detectives. Oooh, I'll go make some tea. Oh, poopsies, what's going on? O-o-o-o-o-oh! Is it over? Oh, Poopie-kins, it's very early. Sweetie, can't we go after school? Oh, you've been so helpful, I uh, just don't know how to thank you. Ohoho, nhn. Yes?  Oh hi. Oh, what is it? Oh, that's so nice. Oh, that's so sweet. Oh, I love you too, poopiekins! That's my little boy."
"KYLE","-Ah damn it, my little brother's trying to follow me to school again. Ike, you can't come to school with me! Dude! Don't call my brother a dildo. I don't know... and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either! Well, what?! Yeah! Check this one out! (to Ike) Ready Ike? Kick the baby Kick the baby. Really, what about? Totally! Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows! Woa! They gave you an anal probe, Cartman? We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass. Why are you walking so funny, Cartman? No, Ike! Go home! This is it!! This one's for the game. Kick the baby. Dammit, he's still there! No, dude, if something happens to him my parents are gonna blame me! OH MY GOD!!!! Ike!!! STOP THE BUS! Ms. Crabtree, you have to stop this bus! (SCARED) No. But I.... AAHHH!!!!! We have to do something! What am I going to do? My little brotherü¾£¤¼s been abducted by aliens. You farted! (TO STAN) Oh man, I can't just sit here! I have to help my stupid brother or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling - ""Where's your brother, Kyle!"" ""You weren't looking out for your little brother Kyle!"" ""You know he can't think on his own, Kyle. Brush and Floss, Kyle!"" ""Where has that finger been, Kyle?!"" Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now. No, my little brother has been abducted by aliens. It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe! Mr. Garrison, seriously, I HAVE to go!  Can I PLEASE be excused from class? I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking YOU! (SIGHING) Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?... Dammit! Dude, he's farting fire! Hey look! There's Wendy Testaburger! Dude, what does the note say?! Whoa, maybe you can kiss her. C'mon you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back! Bad. Chef, have you ever had something happen to you... But nobody believed you? No! That was cool! (pleading) Please Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me. Okay, so how do we get my little brother back? He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the visitors. HEY!! IF YOU VISITORS CAN HEAR ME -- BRING ME BACK MY LITTLE BROTHER GOD DAMMIT! GIVE ME BACK MY BROTHER! YOU BASTARDS!! COME BACK HERE!! COME BAAAAACK! DAMMIT! We were so close! Now do you believe us Cartman? (Pulling Kenny's head off) He's DEAD, Cartman. Go on and go home you Fat Chicken! You're all I have left, Stan. You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared... Up there all alone... You gotta help me dude! Rats! Well, looks like she's not gonna show up, Stan. Let's go look for the visitors now. You can't talk to Stan, Wendy, he throws up when you do. Look, could you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother? Just make sweet love down by the fire. ...And now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed! Why? Hey, you're right Wendy! C'mon Stan, We have to go get Cartman! Come on, Eric, we're going to go play at the bus stop. How come the visitors aren't coming for him? Yeah all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the visitors are sure to come. Sure you do! Fart Damn you! Woa! Look at that! Come down here you stinkin' aliens! (Tenderly) V-Visitors...  This morning you took my brother, Ike.  He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football... At first I was happy you took him away... But I've learned something today; that having a little brother is a pretty special thing. Aw, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could just find it in your hearts or whatever you have to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again (still looking down) Did it work? HEY YOU SKRAWNY ASS (BEEP)-HEADS! WHAT'S THE (BEEP) IS WRONG WITH YOU, YOU (BEEP) LITTLE (BEEP). YOU MUST BE SOME KIND OF (BEEP) TO BE ABLE TO IGNORE A CRYING CHILD. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU LIKE!? I BET YOU'D ALL LIKE TO (BEEP) YOUR OWN (BEEP) WHILE SHE (BEEP) ON YOUR (BEEP) (BEEP)!! Ike! Jump down now for the love of God Ike, JUMP!!!! Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on! Ike!!!!! Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career. Yeah, boy am I glad to see you, Ike! C'mon Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner. Yeah, we're running out of friends. Wow, Cartman, the visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school! Nobody HATES rainbows. Rainbows are little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm! No! What marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?! Wow, what did you write about, Cartman? What was your paper about, Wendy? Kathie Lee is coming to South Park? Wow, are you gonna do it? What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground? Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's! What's that stuff? Bulk up to what? Fat Ass? Whoa Cartman, talk about wide load! You're not 'filling out nicely', you're fatter than ever! Cartman, you're SUCH a fat ass, that when you walk down the street people go 'GOD DAMN IT, THAT'S A BIG FAT ASS!' I don't think they're gonna be able to get all of you in frame, Cartman. Stop who? Uh-oh, we're losing him. Oh my God! they killed Kenny! (Shaking his fist) You bastard! Hey!! Come back!! We didn't even get to do our play!! Not Cartman, he get's to be on T.V. anyway. Ready to go hunting, Cartman? (Ms. Cartman's voice) Don't get scared up in the mountains, Cartman. I like chocolate milk! Wow, that'd be cool! What d'ya mean? I guess so. What? Shoot it, Stan! Hey, what's that???? You were scared, Cartman! You almost peed your pants! Yeah, Cartman's pee. Shut up, Cartman, you can't scare anybody. Deformed how? A knife! Patrick Duffy?! Dammit, Cartman, that's not scary! Yeah, gimme that flashlight! What is that? Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand. Stan! Stan wake up! I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away! They're out fishing with Kenny. Well Stan, you want to know what I think? Look! Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying! Look up there! Kill it Stan. Kill it! C'mon Stan kill it! Oh my God! they killed Kenny! Oh my God!! Look at his leg! AAAAGGHHH!! Whoa, he built a wicker basket. Hey look, Kenny's OK. Yea, make up your mind dude. Who's that? Wow, cool! You're on, dude! I think the OTHER dog's the one that's confused. Who's Middle Park? Hey Stan, isn't that your dog? You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys. Did it work? Ooh la la! Who cares if your dog is gay. Maybe it's not that bad. Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else. What'd he say? Come on, dude, we have to get to practice. Ah chef, CHEF!!! CHEF!!!!! What's the matter, dude? Wow, it's been like two days. Well, we'll help you look for him after the game. You what? But I never practiced quarterback. Cartman you hike me the ball. Then somebody run and I'll throw it or something. Ready... Set... Set... DAMMIT CARTMAN!! Cartman farted! No way, dude! Oh, dude, weak. HIKE! OH MY GOD! THEY'VE KILLED KENNY! YOU BASTARDS!! Hey Stan! I'm open I think!! Yeah, but that sucks you get your butt kicked by a girl Stan. You mean this one? He's my new pet elephant. I got it mail order from Africa. The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three. No it's not cool! My mom won't let me keep him in the house. She says he's too big. And that its poop is bigger than our couch. Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart like elephants. (Whispering) Uh, oh this is the new retarded kid. Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant. See ya. Mr. Garrison? With genetic engineering, can you make a elephant smaller? That's it! I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make... POT BELLIED ELEPHANTS! They'd be smart like elephants but small like pigs! Shut up Terrance, we can genetical engineer anything we want. I bet you can't! Genetic engineering ranch?! Sweet! We can use Cartman's pig. We're not gonna hurt her. We just need some of her blood. Ready to go Stan? To the genetical engineering ranch! We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant. Why is your sister so mean to you, dude? This must be it. No Cartman! We're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together. It's just a stupid pig. What the hell would you know, you fat sweaty mongoloid!? You never get higher than a D! There's no Jews in San Francisco you retard!!! -- Uh... Yeah... We want to cross breed an elephant with a pig. No no no, we want to make little potbellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets! (To Stan) How does that make the world better? Well what about our pot-bellied elephant? Which song is that? Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for? Watch out Stan, genetic engineers are crazy!!! No, we're already half-way done! It's more than you've got. Oh my God! They cloned a foot! We need to genetically engineer a pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice. I told you guys. You hear that, dudes? We'll be rich! We've got work to do Stan. I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk. Yeah Stan, she's just a girl. Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelley. The next time she's going to kick your ass just tell her 'Shelley, you're my sister and I love you.' Try it. We'll see you in a while, we've got to go get Cartman's pig. Come on Kenny! Come on, Elephant! Keep drinking! Dammit! This is never gonna work!! Rotten! They're both really drunk, but they won't have sex. Hey, look! It's working! Yeah. When does mother nature go from ""beautiful"" to ""ugly""? Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant? A couple of days? But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow! Is he bigger than a regular clone?! Come on, Stan! Don't you even know where you would go? Oh my God! Come on! Let's go! Wait Stan! There he goes! He recognizes you, dude. What should we do with him? He's tearing up the house. Stop him!!! Oh my God! They killed Kenny! (shaking his fist at the microwave) You bastard!! Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not. See ya! Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should any time now. Wait, Wait, the pig just gave birth, it had a baby!!! Does it look like a pig or an elephant? (Collecting himself) Dude, it's 'Terrance and Phillip'. But EVERYBODY watches Terrance & Phillip! OW! What the hell was that for?! Well, I didn't have her do it, she did it on her own! Well then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna. Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Laborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in trouble at all. But won't your grandpa be there? Well yeah, but what if the grandpa wants to die, 'cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help? I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance. Hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it? Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman! Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again!! Dude! This is SWEET not having any parents around! What are they doing in there? Yep, all done. Yeah, stupid. Whoa, what is that?! Yes, I think that parents get only get so offended by television because they rely on it as a babysitter and the sole educator of their kids. Totally dude. Quick! Jump out the window!! Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!! AAGH!! Oh my God! They killed Kenny!! (To Death) You bastard!! Hey Stan, now that Terrance and Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment? Hey! Why don't we go watch some of those porno movie thingies? You bastards!! It looks like a UFO! Dude, it can't be cooler than mine! Ha ha! You look like a pansy! What are you supposed to be? (Laughing) Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy, dude?! No way, dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume! Wow, Cool! Cartman... What kind of costume is that? NO IT'S NOT COOL! Sissy Hey look, Kenny's not dead. Yea, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you? Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume! They're gonna be so jealous -- (Incredulous) EVERYONE came as Chewbacca? Dammit! Dude, dressing up like Hitler is NOT bad ass! Wookies don't live on Endor! At least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore Magazine! I'm never going to win that 2 tons of candy looking like everyone else! I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can STILL win that candy! Aren't you hungry Kenny? Check THIS out! I'm the whole solar system!! The planets even all revolve the right way! That tub of candy is as good as mine! Dude, I thought she was dead. WHAT?! But she looks just like everybody else! Up yours Tina Yothers!!!! Hey dudes. Check. What's that? You STILL didn't get a costume, Kenny? Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating peoples' brains... (also realizing) ...if everyone has been turned into Zombies... Chef! You've got to help us! Yeah. I'm scared. I found it!! I found it!!! See Cartman?! Your mom IS on the cover! Chef!! But the zombies are coming! There's a bunch a zombies here!! Uh... okay. Then what? Original Zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original Zombie is? Wait a minute... That thing landed on Kenny... And they took HIM to the mortuary... Oh my god I killed Kenny! You bastard!! It's working! They're turning back to normal! Yeah... He was too young to be taken from us!! No, dude, that's Christmas. Costumes and candy. We can eat it at Cartman's house and see more naughty pictures of his mom! (Opening the envelope) What is this, Cartman? Kick ass, dude. Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever! Damn! What a FREAK! Yeah, mine says 'Red Mega-Man'. Yeah, that's weak! You can't sit with us new kid! Go find another table!! Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck billed platypus! Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weird-o freak. (Pointing) The new kid. We told you, dude! Yeah, look what he did to our friend Kenny. Kay. Oh, dude! We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between good and evil. Hey Jesus, If you win the fight can you turn Kenny back to normal? Yeah, we're gonna call you fart boy from now on! See ya! We have to find red and green mega- mans for Cartman's birthday party. Yeah. You aren't having doubts are you? (Ignoring him) Here, Jesus, drink these raw eggs. Yeah, you have to hit him. Hey, you just got here, Chef! And neither are YOU, PIP! Wow! Hey... You're not such a bad guy after all, Damien! It's a game, dude. It's really fun. AAGHGH!! THEY WERE ALL OUT OF 'EM, DUDE!!! SOMEBODY bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still has money on you. Uh... Stan... Stan... Stan!! Nancy Karrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second. Yeah, dude. Wow, did he say that in the bible? Hmmn. You bastard!!! Yeah, just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over. Oh, Cool! Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House. Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman. Did they say if its water-proof? What'd she say? Ass rammer. Ask her if we get the watch right away! I can't wait to get out of school and get our Taiko Sports watch! Hey look you guys! THE DIGITAL SPORTS WATCH IS HERE!!! Hey... It looks like one of those Etheropians. Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid! Whoa! That was cool! What's your name, dude? Nice to meet you, Starvin' Marvin! Come on, Starvin' Marvin! I want you to meet my little brother. Okay, okay we'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week. Then at Stan's, then with me. Totally! This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin. Yeah, that one. (To Stan) Aw! I TOLD you we shouldn't have brought him to school, dude!! But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving. Because why? Then you take care of him. You better watch what you say Cartman. You might be poor and hungry some day. Wow! Those are some PISSED OFF turkeys!! I don't know. Do you know where he is Marvin? Here you go turkeys! You bastards!!! Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman. Yeah... (Thinking) And that means that McGyver is a real person too. Come on, Mary, PUSH!! I can see its head!!! It's a boy!! Sorry. Shut up, fat boy! I can sing the Mr. Hankey song! Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo! He loves me, and I love you! Mr. Hankey the Christmas poo, haven't you guys ever heard of it? We can too! OFFICER BARBRADY!! IS IT ILLEGAL FOR JEWS TO EAT CHRISTMAS SNOW?! DAMMIT! No, but I get Hanukkah presents for EIGHT DAYS!! Wait! I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey the Christmas poo! Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet. Well, you're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fat ass! It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas My friends won't let me join in any games And I can't sing Christmas songs Or decorate a Christmas tree Or leave water out for Rudolph 'Cause there's something wrong with me My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's Divinity I'm a Jew A lonely Jew On Christmas... Hanukkah is nice, but why is it that Santa passes over my house every year? And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latkeef. Instead of Silent Night I'm singing Ooo chach to ga vive and what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles tell me please! I'm a Jew A lonely Jew I'd be merry, but I'm Hebrew On Christmas. What's going on you guys? Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman! (Shouting out) Hey, how about Mr. Hankey The Christmas Poo? Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet. It's true! He doesn't care what faith you are! (Singing) Mr. Hankey The Christmas Poo! He loves me! And I love you! Therefore, vicariously, he loves you! Even if you're... Wait! But dad! He always -- (defeated) There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey. There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey. (Under his breath) Probably just another stupid dreidel anyway... I said Ike's on fire. It isn't fair! I don't want to be an outcast! I'm not hearing that. Mr. Hankey? Go away, Mr. Hankey. I said go away. My dad says you aren't real. Mr. Hankey! SHHH! I'll get in trouble! NOTHING! Mr. Hankey come here! Say something Mr. Hankey! Mr. Hankey! Where the hell did you go?!

Hey, Yeah! Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fat ass! Really? And I got these killer Berkenstocks. Screw you guys, I'm KING lesbian!! So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go? Down by the fire? You bastard!! Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian? I've been thinking, Wendy... This whole outcome is pretty strange... How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for... Woa, check it out, dude. It's got little drawings on it. I don't know. That was cool! You threw it away, Cartman! It's MINE now! No way, fatty! It's mine!! You threw it away, fatso!! Well, I was just digging around and I was all like 'Dude, I found this triangle'. And my friends were all like, 'dude'. And I was all 'Dude'. I'm gonna put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it!! What would you use a marble sack for? I didn't STEAL anything. GOOD!! No. (Covering his ears) AGH! Stop that! (Suspicious) Yeah... YOU THREW IT AWAY, CARTMAN!!! Yeah, how'd you know? Triangle of Zinthar? AGHAGH!! Cartman?! What the hell are you doing?! Well Ike, YOU can tell CARTMAN that it's MY TRIANGLE!! Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, TAKE the stupid triangle!! If it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damn thing, here!! There! Now get out of my house and I hope you feel really, REALLY good about yourself! Dammit, Cartman! I gave it to you so you would SHUT UP!! YOUR triangle?

She must be powerless now!! NO MORE BARBARA STREISAND EVER!!! 'Disinigration' is the best album ever!! We've got to get rid of them. NOBODY should have the kind of power Barbara Streisand wanted. Dammit, Cartman don't you ever learn anything?! Well, that whole experience sure did suck. But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead. Yeah! Woa, dude!! Hi, we were wondering why fat ass -- I mean, Cartman -- hasn't been showing up for school. Come on! Let's go make fun of him!! Really? Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman. Yeah, he was doing their voices and pouring tea for them. What do you mean? How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs? Yeah, dude, it looks riveting. Yeah, he's almost as bad as that guy on Full House. Man, Cartman's more screwed up than I thought. Wow!

Wow, I guess reading really does suck ass. We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, mkay? Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend? No, it's his bris. I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food. And a band. Uuuh. I'm not sure. Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us. How's it going? Why bad? Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind, the consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits. No. Hey! Are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend? No, not ham, you fat fuck! Your heart? Hey, wait! Stop who? What? Chop off his weewee?! Are you sure?! That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that! I won't believe it. I won't. I have to ask my mom and dad! Mom, Dad! Mom, Dad? What exactly is this party for?! Meaning what? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! I can't believe my parents are cannibals! I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!  Come on, Ike! Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back. Just give me thirty minutes. Come on, Ike! Come on, Ike. Hurry up! Where's the next train going? You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike? I need one ticket for my little brother. Huh? But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong! They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, misteruh, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses. Dammit!  Ike. If you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train. Ready Ike? Kick the baby! Bye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal! There! What do you think? I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner. Not if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away. No! Go away! Bad dog! I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop. Anyway, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.  Knock it off, asshole! Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He, he's been cranky. Bye-bye seeme mama.  Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up. No Mommyuh he, he doesn't want you kissing him! Put him down, you stupid dog! Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it? What??? You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?! Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska! Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility. You bastards! Aw, how the hell should I know? All the time: ""Look out for your little brother, Kyle,"" ""take care of your little brother, Kyle,"" and he wasn't even really my little brother. Yeah, right! He's not my brother! I'm sorry, Ike. What do you want?! Oooh no you don't! That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian! No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie. Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you! You stay away from my little brother! You aren't gonna cut off his weewee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo! And you! You should be ashaned of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?! No!  No, it isn't true! It's okay, Ike. I'm here. Ike, you're okay. Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about. And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family.  Except for Cartman. Mkay? No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school. I caught it! I caught it! Here, Pip. You throw. Come on, limey, don't be a wuss!

Hey yeah. He and Ned do that stupid TV show. Cartman, what kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun! Are there any questions?  Yes, Mr. Garrison? F minus? Can he do that? How do you know?! You weren't even there! Yeah, dude. Your uncle Jimbo sucks ass! We've gotta get him back, dude! Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing! Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy bzzztü¾ ¼ Dude, I can't believe they fell for it! Come on! We've gotta make another one! Drrr, Cartman! Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk! Are you ready Cartman? Dude, they're gonna look so stupid. Look! Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke! Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic! Who are you? You bastards! Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned! Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable. Wait a second. Where is your producer? Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway! Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there. I know, but, it's really snowy today. Oh, she would, dude. She would. Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck! I'm scared! Yeah, what are we supposed to do? 'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches! I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.' Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on. We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days. What? Worse than this? How come the visitors aren't coming for him. Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come! Sure you do! Fart, damn you! Whoa, look at that. Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream. You can say that again. Nope. Calm down, dude. You're upsetting Kenny. Don't do it, kid. Holy crap, dude! On Wednesday or Thursday? Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus. Hey. Maybe it's that thing, Scuzzlebutt. Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned. Oh my God! Look at his leg! Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg! Dude! He's making ice cream. Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us! What was what? What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against. Hey yeah, I remember that. Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you! Youü¾ ¼ bastard. Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right? You bastard! We've just gotta stick together. You bastards! Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too? What are we gonna do? There.  I think we got it. Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does. Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own? Don't do it, kid. Holy crap, dude!  Hey look! He's got ice cream! Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it. Du-hude! Your dad's a retard! Wait a minute.

Gone are the dark clouds that had me- Could it be? Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello? It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey! Well, I'm sure it was him. So how was that movie last night, dude? Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass. Well? There it is again! It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble. Where does that grill go? Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!  Come on! Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer! We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey. What the hell? In a sewer? Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid? Mr. Hankey! I told you guys he'd be here! What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?

Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food. He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his -egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide worldeh, and I don't want him to die. Huh?? Dude, no one even listened to me. Mr. Hankey!  Mr. Hankey?!  Mr. Hankey? They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie. We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface. It's the only way to prove to them that you're real. Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die! Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'? Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on! You guys, we have to hurry! Come on! Everything's gonna be okay! Sir! Sir! I have to show you something.

You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people! Are you guys having a meeting or something? Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here. I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad. Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo!  Well, here's Kenny's house. Heheheh, bun. Oh my God. This is like a third-world country. I don't know. Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with! Cartman! What the hell is that?! No, it's not cool! Yeah. I feel great! Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast. Yes. Why? Nno way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable! Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rats ass about him. Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young? Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food? But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food? Gods and clods? Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods! Could we go home now, Ma? But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do. What's ""ooky mouth""? Sick, dude! Ooky mouth!  Gross! I can't do it, Ma! Aaah! I can't say ""ooky mouth"" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time! It's impossible! What the hell does that have to do with American history? Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes. What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?! So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea. What? Oh my God! You! You! You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick! Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?! You get away from me, you crazy woman! Stan! Stan! Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house andand you and Cartman got sick with chicken pox? Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick! They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway. Yeah. And I think I figured out why. Because they're a bunch of assholes. Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good! Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago? Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face. Nononono. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back. Chef. We wanna know about herpes. Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust. Do you know anybody with herpes? Cool! Thanks, Chef! Are you old Frida? Someone who wants a favor. Huh? Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital. D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes! Aw, man.  I don't feel so good. Ugh. We're sorry. This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman! I'm better now. We gave you guys herpes. Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention. To where? Yeah, all the constellations look alike. You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass! I thought it was ""plane-tarium."" Hey, who are you? Whoopie. Oh, man, I don't feel so good. Me too. It was sweet. Did what? My head still feels funny. Like you really need it, hippo-ass! Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!  KYLE Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again? I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.  KYLE  KYLE What do you mean? Sshh! Why? Oh, yeah. Here's the control panel that operates all the stars. You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars. What does that do? Kenny! What's it doing? We're bastards! We've gotta go tell somebody, quick! But it's true, dude! Don't do it, Officer Barbrady! He's not highly intelligent. Cartman! You saved us! He got a full dose of the stars. Yeah! You're dead! Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat! Well? Now what are we going to do? I donno. Okay. We do? Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrnace and Phillip. Whoa, dude! Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty! Yeah. Hey Stan, wwhat did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare? Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass. What? Why? Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives! It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare! Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday? Fine! Fine! Fine! When is Mr. Hat coming back? When is Mr. HAT coming back? Good guess, dude! Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon. To me?? We should use nails, dude. Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare? Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then? Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy. Okay. Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls. Right. Why? Too eager to what? Okay. Yeah? Umm. Dare? What? What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl! It's just wrong, that's all. What the hell have you gotten me into?! Hoh boy.  Sick!  Aaaaah! Fucking sickening! Okay. Huh? Okay, that's fine. But I don't care. You bastard! Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls. Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs. Dude, that kicks ass! You suck, Cartman! Give me that!  Hey! It hit her right in the mouth! But ih- Here, give me some money, Cartman! Lend me money, fat boy! Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom. Mom, give me some money! I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phlllip dolls. I will if you give me money! Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw. Is it like a- haunted house or something? No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls. You'd better be right, dude. Okay. That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen! That was a waste of money, Cartman! We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game. This ride better be good! We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour! Finally! Yeah. Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me! Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls! You dumbass, Cartman! No, it's not cool! How much do we have left, Cartman? How much do we have left, Cartman?! What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman! You son of a bitch! Aaargh! [lunges at Cartman, and they fall to the ground, wrestling. Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls! Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it? Give him your food stamps, Kenny! Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure! Okay. Here we go.  Hey! That was right on target. That does it! Shenanigans!  SHENANIGANS! I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged! Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator. This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth! It worked! No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there. What?! You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win- Damnit, I have to have those dolls! Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  Think about it, dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls. That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls! Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fuckin' head open! All right! Now, come on! We have to practice! You've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman? That wasn't quite ten seconds. Get back on, fatass! You have to practice! What'd you say, Cartman?? I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull. Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull. Okay, Cartman. You ready? Open the gate! That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything! Get the bull in the balls with a smowball. That's better. Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough! No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing! Get up!  Get UP! Dude, I think we broke him. ü¾ ¼Oh. We need him to win a bullriding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it? Damn it! You think? He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute. Yeah, I think so. Hey, where's Cartman? He's up in, like, twenty minutes! Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake. What do you mean? Hang on, Cartman! Go help him, Kenny! You bastard! How many ball does that get us? You will? We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls! What are we gonna do with them? ü¾ ¼What the-? After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS! Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off! Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh. Really? What about? When is Mr. Hat coming back? He'd be better used as a coat rack. He's singin' some new hit song. What, dude?? Wow, then you should get money for it! Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time. It's the same goddamned song! We'll get my dad to be Chef's lawyer! I don't know. I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman. What's goin' on? Yeah. Ready, Cartman? What's that, dude? Did you ever know any famous people? You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you. Yeah but, but how? Whoa, dude, this house is huge! Are you Elton John? Ogh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for?! Come on, guys.  Hi. Are you Elton John? We're trying to raise money for our school chef. Yeah, dude. Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time! He's not dying, Cartman! Yeah. Do you know him? Gosh. Thanks, Rick James. We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the moeny you needed. Cartman? But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make? Dude, Chef is gone. Dude, it's over. He's gone. But what are we gonna do? Chef Aid? Hey, that's a great idea! Hmm. This isn't going over so well. Wow, cool! We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnny Cochran to sue you! Well, we helped. You bastard! Dude, that's your song for Wendy! He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test. Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry? Did you eat too many pork rinds last night? What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?! Where have you been, dude? Aunt Flo? Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin. Here he comes. You said you could get us money, Cartman! Well, at least he's back to normal. It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one. That's not cool! It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin? Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!  How are we gonna win the contest with a squash? Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good. God, will you shut up?! Yeah. I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again. You seem tired, Stan. Why? Hoh, that sucks, dude. Cartman? You can't be standing there, Cartman. Because you're standing over there! Uh, Chef? Chef. Chef. Chef! We have problems! Will you stop saying that word?! Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that? Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me. There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book. What? Dude, why is your store called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"" Why? Like what? You kick ass, evil Cartman! You know what I like best about you? You don't say, ""hella,"" like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! Hey, yeah! I almost forgot. Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say ""hella."" Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve? Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman! Leave him alone, butthole! It's the evil pets We can't deal with you saying ""hella"" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe! Which one is the good Cartman? Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?! Oh no, dude! Damn it! That's nice, Cartman. Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours? Please stop. Please stop! What's all that stuff? Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraskaü¾ ¼ Wow! We have to go, dude! I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous. It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me! Cool! Oh, God. Jesus Christ, finally! That was totally gross.

No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas? Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up. We're his oral report buddies. Coffee? I don't think I like coffee. We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes. Come on, you guys! We better get to work! Man, this stuff is strong. Don't worry about it.

We have to here! Sshh, don't scare him. Cartman! Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?! Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid. Show us. Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass. Sooo, what's phase 2? Do you guys know anything about corporations? You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers. What? Big corporations are good!

When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better. This... is insane. That bitch! He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man. Yeah, so? Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around. Good idea. They said that Chef works in one of these buildings Dude! Just take them off! He's a big guy, with a beard. We need you, Chef. Chef, this place isn't you! No way, dude! Chef should be here any minute. I can't believe it! All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball! Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef! Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you? All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off? That's it! This is totally what's happening! Thanks, Mr. Garrison. Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus. Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him. There he is! We have to talk to him! What's tree-fitty? Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus! Well, you are taking Chef from us. This is not a woman! It is a succubus! Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody! I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us. Here! Here! Look at this. It says ""The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power."" I don't know. Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? There's got to be a morning after. In three hours. Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open. He's asleep. Wake up fatass! Bitch. Dirty bitch. Now, Cartman!! Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! You bastard! It's great to have you back Chef! This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen. Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,... Just go behind a tree. Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen! You just squat, stupid! Watch out for ground eels! What do you have to think about? No way, dude! What? Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it! Over here! It just ran by here a second ago. It's stupid You don't like anything, Cartman! Did you smoke some of your mom's crack? What are we supposed to do with him? Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?! What are you doing, fatass?! They want you to have sex, God-damnit!! Shut up!! Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby. Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. Gross! Dude, this sucks ass! We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears. There it is!  That must be of the antelope family. Cartman! Wait! Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something. Mr. Adler? Stan:	Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec. Do you wanna bet? Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him? There. Did you see? He just flipped you off. So, do you agree to fight him after school? We'll see! Yeah. That's not cool, dude. Tweek and Craig are gonna fight. What? Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet! Tweek? Well, Craig showed up. And then Craig was all like, ""Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken."" And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken ; well, everybody in the world saw it! Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya. He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked! Shut up, fatass!! That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass! Tweek's gonna fight Craig! Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby. How?? Not like that! Fine! Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm! Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low. This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him! Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that? Craig just called you a boner! He'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight. You bastards! Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. Boy, do we ever. Yeah. And then Craig's family came on About what? This is freaking me out, dude. Dude! He got a lawyer? Dad?! It's... big. Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from? And you don't see a problem with that? You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you? I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money. Hey, what about that stupid panda? Huh? Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough? Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it! Hoh God, here we go. Isn't that fascism? Do you? What?? You bastards!  Hey! There he is! Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all! NO YOU'RE NOT, DUDE!! YOU'RE A GUY IN A PANDA COSTUME!! Okay, sorry, sorry. That people shouldn't sue each other all the time. Wait! Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had. I'm coming, Ma! ""Get ready,"" ""answer the door,"" Jesus Christ, make up your frickin' mind! Oh! Hey, Kenny. I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee. It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure. Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard. Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me? ...Oh. Kenny isn't special? Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to. Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight. No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform! No, Ike! I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts. What? You want me to lie? Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun- Wow, cool. He was huge. Who are you? You have to go with him, Ike. Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building. Kyle Broflovski. Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg. This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting. That's you, Kenny. Raise your hand. This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up. Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle. This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee. It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it! Sh. Shut up, Kenny. That's Moses, stupid! It's a duck. Don't worry. I know what to do. Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish. He doesn't get cake?? Dude, what the hell is going on?! Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us. Kenny will find a way. Go, Ike! What is that? Look! Kenny! Noooooo! Kenny! You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass. Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween. Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff. Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck. The what? Nuh-uh. Yeah! Let's see how they like it! That's not scary, fatass! He must have a huge bone in his ass, then. Yeah, fatass, a dead body. Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary! Yeah, fatass, we're goona dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma?? Are you insane?! Dude! We'er not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble. Naww, let's dig up somebody else. This must be it. ""Cleo Broflovski"" That's my grandma. Wait. I don't know if this is cool. I don't think my mom would want me doin' this. I don't really care, dude. Oh, my God.  Hi, ...Grandma. Aaaah! Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny! Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back! How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them? Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect! Cartman?! Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads. Shouldn't we hide her better than that? Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonan be sweet! No Grandma?? She's not here! Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again! God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?! Somebody took my dead grandma. Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo. Then, you'll help us? Right. Wow! That was easy. Whoa. What was that? Yeah! Where's Grandma? Hey dudes.  What are those? Huh?? No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll. Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore? Why the hell don't people tell me these things?! What's the Primary Main Objective? Well. what's the Evil Power? What? Shit! Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon? I'm not sure. I don't know. Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon. Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass. Thanks. Neither do I. Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll! What? Huh? No. Damnit! I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! Camp? No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight? What?? ""A-ight""'s not cool, either?? When did that happen? God damnit! ...our hearts.  Kenny? ...Power. Destroy it? Liberace gay. Owatta Beikoku! But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master! What? Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master! So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't? But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. Aw, screw it; I'm too confused. Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you. What's a ""home-schooled kid""? Wow! What?? Definition? Uh, could you use it in a sentence? ""Krocsyldiphic."" ""Krocsyldiphic."" C  Damnit! What's your name? Wooww. Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home? ...Uuh, can I talk to her? U-u-uh, hi. Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all. ...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet. Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance! What?? Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school. Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um, Huh? Uuuh, okay.  Gah! Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go. You will? No no. I mean, go with me. You got my note? Uh, can we sit down? Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that...  flicker of light over there? Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children,  just like us. From public school, your house is just a flicker of light.  Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study Love, for one thing. Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss. When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together. Rebecca, in public school,  we select our... own mate.  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy. I'm not completely sure. No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance? I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up. Don't you ""Oh, brother"" me! She's the woman of my dreams! You suck! Rebecca. You... Uh. All I did was show her how to- Aaaah! Ooww! No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it! Relax, fatass. You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls! Cartman! God job, fatass! Why would anybody send this asshole money? Yeh-hah. Starvin' Marvin! He did take a ship. I think he wants us to get in. Let's go somewhere. Yes! No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too. Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?! Where are we? This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff. Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar. Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'. Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there. Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do! No! Oh, no, dude! I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass! Watch out! Here I come! Kenny! Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home! What was that? Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar. Well, how'd we do it last time?? Which button did you press, Cartman?? You don't remember?! Yeah, now finish 'em off! Where did that come from?? Sorry, Marvin. We tried. It's pulling us in! Marvin... Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars. Thanks. No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth. Cartman, what the hell are you doing? Well, you have to hit it softer! You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat! Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow! Cartman!!! Give me the drum, and you play the flute You dick! He'll show. Wow, dude! Your granpa still isn't dead? Teah! You're dressed up like the South. The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war! No they're not, stupid! How much do you wanna bet?! Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?! And if the North wins you're our slave for a month?? You're on! What do we do?! You cheated, Cartman! Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that! They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop. I know, butü¾³¤¼why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back? Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves?? We have to stop him, dude. We'll give you 10 bucks. You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves! Hey! Yeah. Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history.  You see, history is forever,  and everything happens for a reason.  Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno- We'll never stop them now. Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States. Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year. Yeah. And now you can stake that stupid beard off! Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month! What?? Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate a Channukah.  This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song: Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; do you wanna try? Hey, shut your mouth, fatass! Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play. Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play. Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play. Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play. Hi, Mom! Oh, hi Dad. Sure. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play. Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play. Dad? Dad. We're singing about a dreidel. Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play. Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play. I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives! What, fatass?! You got your what? Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right! Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass. Dude, did you get your period yet? Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty. Yeah. You got your period too, Kenny? Ike, can I talk to you? Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't! Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore. Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little. Thanks a lot, Ike! You guys! I got my period, too! Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place. Awesome! We get powers? Here. I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde. Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m. Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh... Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly. Phew. Okay. Today's word is ""spirituality."" What that means to me is uh- Hormones? Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones. Whoa, dude! Hey, here comes Stan. Did you get your period yet, Stan? How do know that? Shut up, fatass! Cartman, what the hell are you doing? Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants! Nuh-uh! There is no brown noise, fat boy! Who the hell are these guys? Yeah! That's Texas, butthole! Kenny? Alright, dickhole! Ungh, I can't find the word ""queef"" anywhere! Well, let's try the dictionary.  queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef. What's it mean?! What's it mean?! Awwgh! Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means. Yeah. That'll make 'em look stupid! How about... finkleroy? Mung's good. Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh? Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up! Eewww. Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists! What the hell is that lady talking about? Yeah. They think they're so cool. Calm down, Cartman. I don't believe it! That's amazing. Yeah, dude! We have to watch them! We can't miss it! This is gonna be sweet! Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time- Well, that whole experience sure did suck. Huh? Oh, no! Huh? He's fat and he's stupid? No way! I only got a jar of gifelte fish. ...Totally what? Me too. You still have baby teeth, Kenny? Almost. You ready, Timmy? When I say ""go,"" you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy? Right. You're Timmy. Alright! Get ready, Timmy. Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth. Yeah, let's go. No, Timmy, wait! Come on, fatass! Did the tooth fairy come? Four dollars? No more money?? Cartman, what's going on?! What do you mean, ""there's no tooth fairy?"" That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me. You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real! It's not true! Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh? Oh my God! You did lie to me. Peter Pan, too?? What about Moses and Abraham? Probably?! Is Atlantis real?? Wahahahah! Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah! What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real? All made up. Not real. Nothing's real. Oh my God, what if I'm not real? I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality? What if this is all just somebody's dream? Two years? Cartman! See ya. Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality. Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one. Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't? I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist! But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together? Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down,  and my own existence fading. Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave. Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening! I am nothing, and everything. Hunh. That was pretty weird. Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What Oh yeah?! Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it! Fatass. What the hell are they doing? Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde. Yeah, fatss! Get your fat butt on the sled! Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move. Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! We killed Kenny? Well, that didn't work. What else can we try? If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was. How? Sweet! Let's go! Hey, fatass. How's prison? Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here. So we made you this cake.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it. An ailnay ilefay. Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray! They on'tday?!  Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray! Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo- Me too. Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. So now what do we do? Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away. Yeah. But isn't Token the only one? Killer. Well then,  you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass! Damnit! Son of a bitch, damnit!  Oh, sorry. Huh? Why not? I don't start, you start. And we think that that is  a savage hypocracy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime? But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday. He's gotta show up. He's just got to. Dude, I guess we've jsut got to try it without him. On the sled, fatass! Go, fatass! Oh no! The girls are gonna win! We won! We won! It's good to have you back, Cartman. Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning. The Declaration of Independence? Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder. ...I am eight. No way! Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy? We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin. That's correct, Chef. Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium No, not at all. Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin? Yes, let's. You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer. Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house. Bastard. Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us. Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us. Come, see him with us. Yeah. Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo! Yeah! Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my! Awwww! How long does this thing last? Whoa. Those contorting Romanian chicks rule. Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical! Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville. Let's go practice. It's Kenny's singing! What?! What's a ""quin-tuplet""? But there's only four of you. So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike? How can you say that? Oh, yeah! Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going. You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there. Alright! Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now?? Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?! Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway. Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card.  You lose a turn. What? AIDS?! What? You don't know what you're talking about, fatass! See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out. I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this.  Waaaaah! Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh. We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt. Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny. What are you talking about, fatass? They are? We don't wanna go! We don't WANNA go! Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too. Yeah.  HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH? Dude. Being mature is boring! I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here! Dude! We're surrounded by perverts. How? Dude. You have sex with children. Dude. You have sex with children. Seriously. Well, Cartman Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here? I don't know, I... How much? Better, I think. Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan. Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore! Told ya. Yeah, we got it. Yeah, me neither. Not really. Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want. Who wants to read them? Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus! I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner. Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend. Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there. Pretty good, I guess. Kenny ate all the mints, dad. Oh. Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the bieginning of time. All animals kill.  And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing. Huh? W-we really didn't see it that way. Y-yeah, but... the color of someone's skin doesn't matter. Yeah. Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan? No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist. ...How? I'm not being in any  faggy boy band! Wait a minute. There's only four of us. So, all boy bands have five members. *N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids On The Block. All had five members. It was? I pormised my mom I'd let him try. Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else! Dude, what are you talkin' about? that was awesome! Me too. I wanna be the tough one. I wanna be the tough one! Jews are tough! Since Abraham, fatass! Jesus Christ! Wow. I feel so rejected. Run for it! Dude, what's wrong with your leg? Wew. There must be at least 20 people out there. He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche. Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid! It's Stan! Dude, where the hell have you been?! You bastards! Dude, he's pretty dead. We don't have a fifth member, Cartman! We made two dollars. Yeah. ...Yeah. That's gonna suck. Hey, dudes. What are you doin'? Uhwuwhat? No-o-o-o-o! Oh good. I don't? I am not! I'm gonna go ask my mom! Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell? Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell. We don't? But what if we're wrong? Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell. Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me! Mister Father!  We have to ask you something. Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell? Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please. HAAAAH! ...But what if we're wrong? Yeah, and this life is short. The afterlife is forever. Yeah, this church kicks a- eh- it kicks! Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith! Ask him what hell is like. Yes! Yes! Ow! Uh, I think so. Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this. You're keeping that money yourself? Then why didn't you tell us?! The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass! Serves you right, Cartman! Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too! Ungh, gay, dude. You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver. He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship! ...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses. Together we are strong! Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom? Holy God, dude! Yeah! And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at. I just didnt think it would come so soon. Huh? Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was. How? Oh yeah, time travel. Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement. So can you do it? I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls! Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him! Come on! What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair! No?? Oh no! What have we done?! What do you mean, ""can't""?! You made it work; just build us another one! Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up! Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing? Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science! Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either. Yeah! You suck, Cartman! Hey, Timmy's back! Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten. But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper!  It has five different compartments for each subject in school.  And it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek. God-damnit, you only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me! He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius! He's smarter than you, fatboy!! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought- Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! You are? I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass! No I don't! I don't care! Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out! I'm gonna! I will! Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different. Whoa, dude! Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast. That should do it. Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one! Don't you get it?! You can't have ANY Trapper Keeper, fatass! Hey! What are you doing? Oh. Okay. Yeah, that'd be faster. Here we go again. Damnit Cartman, open up! Cartman??  He's not gonna open it! Break it down! Okay. Ready? One Two Three, Not it! You ba- Why is that bad? Step on it, Bill Cosby! Not- Aw, Damnit! I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU. Screw you, fatass! Cartman! No! I can't reach the CPU. Got 'em! I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak. Can we take a lunch break now? What is it, Butters? We can't be outdone by the kindergartners! Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story. Okay! A smart one, that can do tricks. Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed! What?! Aw, dude, don't say that! Alright, we'll take him. How much? But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head! ...God-damnit, here!  Alright, Timmy, let's go! Aw, blow it out your ass! It's a turkey.  His name is Gobbles. Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one... I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him? Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it. Timmy, we already got a turkey. Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off. What Butters? So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat? You ready for the big show, Timmy? Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey? He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave. Hey, look! Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be. Aw, don't be such a baby!  You do it, Kenny. Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it! Aw, dude, check this out. Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this? I'll give you ten bucks to eat it. Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast! What's the matter? Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it. Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen!  How much, Kenny? I'll give you five bucks.to eat your puke. That's 19 bucks, Kenny! Kick ass, dude! Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff. Whoa! What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months. Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman. Good point. Huh? Why not? I don't know. Why? Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you? Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough? Six hours. Great. For what? Three months?! But the per-per-view is tomorrow! He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus. ...Alright, that does it!  This has been bothering the hell out of me!  I knew it! You're not Cartman at all! Don't wory, dude. You're gonna do great. Hoh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time! Hepatitis B? ...You got Raging Pussies tickets?? Hold on. I'll be right back. Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies? But all the guys are going! But Mom, I- Ugh! My parents said I can't go. Ah. Oh, now I already told them. No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later. ...But what if I do a bunchof chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair! What's Cuba? And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on? Hoh, geez.  KYLE I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies! What?? But I did! Ah, I brought -democracy to Cuba! But that's not fair! You lied to me! What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?! We I wish I didn't have any parents! It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?! They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS! How?! What's that? Wow! Three months without parents! Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats. ""My parents molestered me."" What's ""bad touch""? Okay, molestered, bad touch. Cool, thanks. ...Nothing. Not one adult left? Yeah. The fatass. The mayor. Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that. Sure, outlander. I'll get it Parents. Mom. Dad. Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone. Here's our cell phone, dude.  Will you call the police for us? Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days? Did you make it to your job interview? Well, thnaks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are. Mom! Dad! Yeah. We're fine. But you didn't do anything to me. But, you guys, I- He's gonna be here any minute, Ike. Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Come sit by me. Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does. Happy Chanukah, Mom. Go away! Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bos stop in ten minutes! Okay, good. You're all here. It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet. It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad thins have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come. If you guys want thre to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me! Dude, you sneezed on my back! Hey, look.  Hello? ...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was weiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that- But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit. A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer. Sure we'll help! Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around! Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it!  It's so simple! We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town! How hard can it be? Look at it. Mayor! We have the solution to your problem. We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and and play it on the screen at the old drive-in. You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news! Ah, Mr. Hankey? We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card. Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days. Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got. They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us. God job, Butters. See ya! No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later. What's a hard p? Oh, yeah. We wish- What? Well, yes, I think so. Dreidel dreidel dreidel, Don't you oppress me, fat boy. Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass! Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame. Yeah. So what's the first syllable? Okay. So we put little ""woo"" mouths on all our heads.  And then we shoot that for one frame. That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot! Now, the next mouth. Okay, where are the E-mouths? Okay. ""Woo"" mouths again? So how much done is that? Aw,  Jesus Christ! Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames. Cartman! Fine! We'll do it with out you! We'll dub his voice over. Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. You love- -And I'll labor. You sit- -And I'll stand. You could do Cartman's voice, can't you? Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter. Cool! Now let's try the script! Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy. You wish- -And I'll whittle. You sit- -And I'll stand. Let's all try to help a little, 'cause Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit! Okay, Mr. Hankey! What? Yeah, I think so. What? Dreidel dreidel dreidel- All that hard work. But we spent it! All that work! Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey. What the-- They did it! They got it working! ...We actually spoke--to the Brian Boitano. Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted. What? Ah. Yeah. You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas! Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days. Four tickets to The Lion King on stage! Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool. What, doughboy?! What? What?! Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama? They're gonna say ""shit"" on television? Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage! It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip? It's stupid! No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV! Hey! Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else. How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word! I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid! I don't really give a fuck! Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel sooo much better now! Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  It's still the same old world out there. Look.  What the hell? Oh, whatever. This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright. It's NOT NEW!! I'm gonna look ""shit"" up in the encyclopedia and PROVE it!! THERE'S NO SAND IN MY VAGINA!!! You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, ""shit!"" I think it might have something to do with people dying! Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said ""shit"" on television. I am not full of meekro- what? Look, the word ""shit"" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, ""the Black Death."" Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on! Chef, do you know where ""shit"" comes from? No no no! The word, ""shit."" Ungh, it said in my book that the word, ""shit,"" started the exact same time as something called, ""The Black Death."" Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it ""skite"" and started calling it ""shit."" The same year as the Black Plague. A c...curse word. Cartman, this is serious!!! Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire! We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  ""shit"" will becvome an even more acceptable word! Cartman, stop being an asshole! We think that you might have could it by helping make ""shit"" an everyday word. It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny. ...Nnno Now what? We need some help identifying an ancient English stone. And asshole. Wait! It's okay. The curse has been lifted. You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems. We're all saying the S-word too much! The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. ""Curse words"" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances. That's pretty cool, dude! He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass. Wow, that's cool! Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe! ""David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic."" Dude, we gotta go. I'm not really happy. My potential hasn't even been reached. Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine: We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four.. So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95. You're Stan? Where's Kenny? I'm Kyle. What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff. But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow.. What are we doing? Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere. It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something. Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brlliant man I'm not going anywhere! Huh? I thought you wanted to leave! You're Stan. Then I guess... I'm a dumbass. Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respectr that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you. That's right. ...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square. David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you! How many tickets can we put you down for? Great! That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver. I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- This is a really good turnout. Dude, no way! Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blainetologist. Yeah. Why is that good news? Mass suicide? Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman! It's jsut me. Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore. I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad. I thnk we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too. Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman: thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell? What have you done, Cartman?! Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale! Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this! Cartman, no! You bastards! You bastards! Stan! I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water! Wagh. Thanks for savign us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend. What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! ...What the hell are you talking about?! What's ""pubes""? Oh.  No you didn't! Hell no! Uh what are those? Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader? Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself! Yuh huh! Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars! Yeah. Carman, can I give you some advice? Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you. One please. Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off. What's in it for us? Okay, Cartman, what do you want? Oh, Jesus! Okay, so what's the plan? ...What? You're such a dumbass, Cartman. Scott Tenorman? We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your weiner bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch. 'Cause, we're his friends. 'Cause we hate him. Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya. Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. Yeah, sure. Okay, dude, it's 3:30. Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch. Oh my God! Write the number down! Write the number down!! I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning! What?? Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them. Uhuh, but that's why we're going. Sww, w-we're the official presidents of the Phillip and Terrance Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival. Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem! Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat. Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip? We have to talk to Terrance. Hey! Look at that line!  It's way shorter. Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on.  Sshh. Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform. Phillip, your partner. But the guy who replaced him sucks! But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform. Uuuh, we didn't get them. Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be perfoming with this other guy. Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada. Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side. They told us that ""Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day."" I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times. Ih-it'll be okay. They said they'd come. He's here! Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again? Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day.  You care about Mother Earth, don't you? See? I told you it would work. You can't leave! The show starts soon! You bastards! Hooray for the earth! We must protect it.  And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video! Eh it's ""Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow."" I taped it last month. Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around! I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy! Haaah! Wait! dude, LOOK! ""No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!"" ""Have mercy!""  Yeah ha ha! Nuh uh. What the hell are you doing, fatass?! Kenny wasn't lying. Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it! No... No, this isn't possible. No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars? Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars? Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park. Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come tu us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, ""You know, I learned something today..."" and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow. Great. It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow. So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?! Hunh, I guess you're right. Where are we going? Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts! Hohohooho! Oowwww! Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!! Oho God, get me off of here!! Stahan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!! My life can't get any worse! Sucky. Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you? But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude. Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids? No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God!. Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!! Ah!  Aaah! Awesome. I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me? Satan talked to God? And that's it? That's the end? That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan? Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God. Oh. Oohh.Ohuhughughhh. Huh? Huh? ""No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies."" ""Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!"" ""AAAAAAAH!"" What's this all about, Kenny? No they don't! That's awesome! You ""beat off?"" Yeah... Chef, what's ""laid""? Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed. What the hell is wrong with them? No. Nuh uh. Is that what you learned in sex ed? Oh my God, dude. Yeah. Quick! Well why not? You want us to get AIDS? Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things. Uh, what are ""studzes"" It says you gotta check it for holes or tears. Sure. Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cuase it itches so much. You mean, intercourse with a girl? Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls! Yeah! You get out of town! Man, he's pretty good. Seventeen? Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what? Hyeah, that poor, poor thing Well, why did you pull it out of the trash? Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh? Cool! Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz DRAM I don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park. Awesome!  Oh, crap. I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun. I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. Thanks, Towelie. Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games. Okay, turn it on. Oh, this is so cool. Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it? Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside! She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight.. Uh no. No we don't wanna get high! Me too. Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid. What? You mean Towelie? Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! Where is it? Where the hell is it?? What? Uh-uh-uh what do you mean ""they've taken it""? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!! Where the hell is he? What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere. That's a towel call? Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water. There he is! Just come on! It's getting dark. Are you sure this is where they said to be? Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness! Aw, God-damnit! Are we getting close? How long has it been since you've been back there. The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back! I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is! We're missing out on some quality video game time right now. All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere? Who's they? Okay. Dude, I figured it out. If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight! Seven and a half. That's it? Well let's look in here. What terrifying secret? And we don't care. Go ahead. Photon rifle, whatever. Our GamdSphere! Sweet! Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! I've almost got it! I got it! Awesome! These are gas masks, Butters! Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe. Dude, what's going on? Well what are we supposed to do with it? Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster. Uh oh, they're closing! Yeah. Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us. Hey, wait! There are children in here! Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small space for 20 hours? How could things get any worse? Oh God, it was horrible! Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours! You sonofabitch, Cartman!  You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people! Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too! Is this the right house? Hey! What the hell are you doing?! Then why did you send us the goat? Jawas? Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane! Um...  Greetings from Canada.  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it? Good job, fatass! Oh crap, it's him! But I thought you hate us. Cartman, where are you going?? Cartman, he's crazy! Where do we go? All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America. Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women! Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them. Yeah. I'm confused. Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America. I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England! No. This is taking forever. What, Cartman? It isn't that funny, Cartman. But I never take off my hat. This is how I look natural. Crap! Gayass! Hello? Hello? Cartman? I don't know. Let's go see. Why'd you call us? ...You put Kenny's pictuer on a milk carton?? No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children. ...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time? ...Nuh uh. Hohly crahap, duhude, heh! Uh Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you yuhou'd better go to Kenny's house. Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing? Blew a funny fuse? :	Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out! You gotta come to Kenny's house with us. Alright. Butters! Hey Butters! They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company! Dude, that poor kid. Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them. Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened? Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh. When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turnd out alright, he's able to laugh. There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad. What's he look like? I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother. Hey dude. Oh, uh, wawawhat is this? Oh is, is this beef? Uha, wa, actually, I, I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass. Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh- We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble. What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it? Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier? Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on. Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle. I can't believe how cold it is out here. It's a reall dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze. Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for 29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff? Cartman?! Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's form the same family.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are. ...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker. Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here. Eh, oh, alright. Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters. Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death? Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands. Alright then, hu-how do I catch it? Now what? But it's down in the snow. But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands. Alright, then. Uh you did what? You, you paid your friends tuh...  not make fun of me? Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me. Becuase I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about 12.50. Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go. Boy it sure is dry out here. I'm ba-ack! I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous. It seems like I might get splinters, though. Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast. I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus! It's a least a couple of hours. I'm ba-ack. I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus. Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle. Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long. I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous. Can't we just play hide and seek at home? Oh, Jesus!! In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs. Ub, alright then.  Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle. Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had- Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast! Oh, I did it again!! I'm back. Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there. Well, Kyle, I I gotta go. Yeah, I've gotta get back to Connecticut. Well, I I invested in that IT thng, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I I guess, goodbye, cousin. Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya. Ru really? Listen, guys, I appreaciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter Haha Aharmani Exchange? Yeah, dude.  Nobody does. They're too expensive. What's a VHS? Is that fun? Alright. I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan! Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy. Right. And Stan for being in love with Wendy. And Cartman for being fat And Cartman for being stupid And Cartman for having a whore for a mom. And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy. Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play football, you puss. Yeah, that was pretty good. 'K go! You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay? What, did he lose a hundred pounds? Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?! A trampoline? ...What? I'm leaving right now! You've never watched the news, fatass! And what the hell does that have to do with anything?! Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?! They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases. ...I hate you so much. Yeah, they're gonna get busted again. We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik! Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat. Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know. Kenny's sick? Wait. Kenny's going to die? Cartman.  Kenny's in the hospital. They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die. Hey dude, how's it going? Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude. Hey, uhwe were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan? Stan?  Stan, where are you going? Dude, he needs us right now. I, I know it's tough but-  Look at me! I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now! Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him! Stan, you can't leave! Cartman? Cartman, were you... crying? Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him, too. Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will. ...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, ""We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny."" And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny. Neat, huh Kenny? He said his wish is not to die. He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself. He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over. He just said... ""Where's Stan?"" What, Cartman I actually hugged you. I held you in Aha, and I'll have the City Chicken. Okay, Not-Kenny. Dude! That's today! Excuse me. Could we get through here? Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches? Them? Oh, ""a i d E s"" aides. Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial. But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular. It matters, dude. That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised. That that's diarrhea. That's a great idea! But Butters isn't fat. Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared! City Wok brought him down to a size 4. Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast. Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters. You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise. Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny. Wow! He looks great! Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok. Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials. Yeah, we're all set. Well what do you mean? Wow. Yeah, you're still fat! Why are you doing this to us? Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip. Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. Alright, it's working! It's out of control! To City Wok so we can make our money. God! Yup. Wow, that was pretty good. We have great news! Our friend has lost forty pounds eating your City Wok food. Here's the before and after photos. Uh why not? Wait!  You're all making a mistake! Aw, just forget the whole thing then! Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Becuase then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams. No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee. What Go on, Ike. ...french fries... pizza... french fries...  come on, Cartman. ...French fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-French fries... I wonder where our parents are. Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?! What do you wanna do now? Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Scrwe him, dude. You don't even know Heather! Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend. I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches. Awgh, dude, I can't look. Good job, dude! Mom, Dad! Okay, Not-Kenny. This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick! Cool! Do you think they'll believe it? Awesome! But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin? Yeah. Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters! We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know. We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool. That looks awesome! Why the hell would they want that anyway? Episode I sucked balls. Yeah, he sure is. This is gonna be awesome! Wow! Yeah! We thought of the whole thing! City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms. Aw, dude. Then why the hell do they call it ""veal""?? What?? Yeah. Come on, we've gotta go! 'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole! What?! Screw you, Cartman! No! Have Butters kiss it. Awww! Sick! I felt it on my face! Hyaaaa! You need to freeze some of your ass off. What? Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how. Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house? Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't hve that much blood in him! Butters has that at his house? All right! Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan? You're getting in pretty deep, dude. So what happens now? We're with you, dude. We're with you, Stan. ...No I won't. Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch! Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say. You can tell them... Cartman, stay away from that door! But we will have to sleep, dude. Good night. We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad. He might be right, dude. All right! Yeah! And fried chicken! We're eating, dude. Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether. Dude, that's messed up. You guys, check this out! It is? Huh, what the hell is that? Dude! Those gaywads are on our side? Dude, are you okay? Dude, maybe we should end this. Don't give him anything! Dude! Stan's getting worse, you guys. Stan! It worked! They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay! Mexico here we come! Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on. Oh no! No!! Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry!  Stan? Stan?? Whoa, dude. Do we have everything? Look, it's almost time It's the biggest night of the year. Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway You'd miss the new trailer? Kyle. Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably mke it back in time before the first commercial break. Dude, thank God for stupid people Just don't mess with it, Cartman. Just just leave it alone. God-damnit Cartman! You broke it! God-damnit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house! We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet. No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it! They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage. God-damnit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house. God-damnit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother! Heuh, the commercials! Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show. Get it back to normal, Chef! The TV left. We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology! We're not too late! They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again! Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retared Russell Crowe show! That'd disgusting, dude! It's okay, it's still the show. Oh, dude, I don't know how I can take it. Will your sister let us watch it? Look! Crack addicts with a television! Oh Jesus! Now where do we go?? Uh why not?! This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?! The last commercial break is starting! What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing? That's bullcrap! TV shows are gay! They were wearing cowboy hats!  Did you see??  Did you see?? Hey, that's even better than their first movie, huh? Who wants to tell him? Lame But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were. We're sorry Butters.  Our mind is made up. Phew. Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think. Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend. Towelie is a tough choice because, even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high. But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes. Token.  Clyde.  Craig  Timmy Pip  Jimmy  Jason  Towelie  Luigi . Tweek. This looks pretty good. You're such a fatass, Cartman! Token. Timmy. Tweek.  Pip Towelie. Jimmy. Anything that'll impress us, Token. Well Token was a definite winner for talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there. Yeah! Isn't this great?! Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything. Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on. So? You're a smartass! Good point. Cool. Just stick it on. Yeah. Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny! Yeah. No way. Nuh uh. No way. Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person! Naw, alright. I told you, Cartman. Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning. See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed. Oh God! Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable! We don't know who else to talk to. Wow, I guess this really is a big deal. There's nothing here! Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright. Ms. Choksondik stinks inside. Quick. Hide. Got it! It is? Oh, really?? I'm so glad we're not murderers. Whoa. Whoa. Well what are you gonna do? Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman. Huh. Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us? ...Yeah. So? Hey! It's Tweek. The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side. Hey dudes. What are you guys doin'? In your butts? Why would he puyt anything in your butts? Hm. Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation. Yeah. Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week! It wouldn't work! I don't need to. It wouldn't work. You're on, fat boy! Well, Cartman? Well, go on, smartass, and do it! No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth! Get the fuck out of here! What? Go fuck yourself, Cartman! Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass! So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature! It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a feakin' medal?! HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! So? Cartman, there's something I need to tell you. You were totally, one hundred percent right. You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend. No, dude. They only changed ""terrorist"" to ""hippie"" to make E.T. more P.C. Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were! Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now. Yeah. We'll be the ""Save Films From Their Own Directors"" club ""Free hat?"" Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough. Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats. We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers.. What? Yah. You?? Why? Me. Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up! We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane. Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children. Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark! No. NOO!! Nonono! We need to do this first. We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that? This looks like the right room. That's it! Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas! But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark. ...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart. Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song. It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is. You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed. When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! What?? Yup. Come on, Tweek! Blow it up! Yeah. I I think so. ...What? Do you think we did a good thing, Stan? I mean, no one even seemed to notice. She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay. Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her. I don't know. Dude! Bebe is really smart! Yeah, it's cool. Yeah. Yeah. She's really cool. That was sweet, Bebe.  Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you- I'm showing her. Hoh! Hoh!  Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and- Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh! Hah hah hah! We were throwing rocks at cars. Maybe she's in the lunch line. Yep. Right. Yeah. Huh?? Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning! No way! Tweek's cool! I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe. Hoh hoh hoh! What the hell are you doing? Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today. Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs? But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me. It will. So? Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out! But, wait. Where's the other team? Dude, we weren't playing anybody. You're such a fatass, Cartman. Yeah, it was like four days ago! It was such a long time ago! Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember. Okay.  N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body?? Yeah. Closure. There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny! Alright, we made it! Let him out, Cartman! Is he in there? I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot! Why would they play such a cruel joke on us? God-damnit! There has to be a way! A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny. Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard. Cartman? Cartman?! Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?! Maybe you got brain cancer. Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back. Do you see anything? Grandma?? Huh? What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?! Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven! HAAHH!!! Hey Kenny. You're too fat to be Kenny. What?? For God's sake, why?? Are you gonna burn me? Jesus Christ! You did, dude! You drank his whole body! Yeah. Good job, fatass! We're all gonna pitch in on an entry! Okay.  N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. What do you mean, fatass? Do you see anything? Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home. Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now. Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy. Whoa.  Kenny, you in there? Stop him, Kenny! That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one! But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it? Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph! I'm a Paladin, Cartman! Quick! A monster of Rivendell! Gentlemen, we are OFF! The Queen and King of Stan's's house wish the Lord of the Rings returned to them. Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest! Okay, fine Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. Butters, what the hell are you doing?! Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us! This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite awfully. Oh, crap, the sixth graders! You can't keep it. Dude, that video is making people act strange. We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape. Hide! Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed. Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... the Lord of the Rings. This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes. Two Towers Video Store. Ih in Conifer. Paladin! We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak. We were almost killed. Hey, what are you guys doing? You guys. Somebody is following us. Butters? Jimmy, are you sure? They're gonna take the Lord of the Rings from us. Yeah. Good job, Wizard Fatass! Now we're totally lost. Oh brother! No Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before. Oh no! They're closed! Finally.  It's over. Butters! No! It has to go back! Let go of the tape, Butters! Fine! Middle Earth is again safe. Funny. Not him! Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat. Hey guys, can we talk to you? Uhh, not cool. Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay. ""Fat tits."" That's a good one. Bad. Gays, I guess. Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass. We don't wanna be gaybashers, Chef. Uh, a bear? Eh I, I don't know what else to paint. Aaaa! People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow! Oh. Can't... glue... any... more . Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care. Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix. Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care? We're gong to New York? Oh cool. We get to watch a movie? We have a dead friend. Yee-yeah. I'm Kyle. Yeah. My Grandma.  She's here? Oh my God! Grandma's watching me. Always watching me. Four white birds! There's four white birds!  This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard. So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday? I'm not going back. I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them. Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants! He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma! You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you. You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever. Throw it away, Clyde! Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something. What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say. ...Where did you have sex with her? Wow. That's pretty cool. 'Cause, artard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows. Hey, what happens to me in the future? What are you doing, Cartman? What's it? That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this? Mr. Hankey! Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq. But how are we gonna get to the North Pole? Yeah. Me neither. Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman?? Finally! Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes? Wow, cool! Is that what this is all about?!  You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?! Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing? What are you doing? Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down! All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that! We don't know. They lost all contact with him. Jesus, behind you! You bastards. On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody! Mom! Dad! We rode on Santa's sleigh! Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll! Ah, damn it! My God-damned little brother's trying to follow me to school, again! No, Ike! You can't come to school with me. Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo! Yeah. Check it out.  Ready Ike? Kick the baby! Kick it! Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night. Really? What about? Totally! Yeah. This does seem really familiar. Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream? You don't? Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car. And then you said Weird Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day. What is a proc-tologist, Chef? What a dick! Other than his monstrous size. And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it. Are you okay? No way!  You do it, Kenny! I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt! God-damnit Cartman! Stop it Cartman! God Damnit! That's it!  I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it! No! You're lying! That does it! CHARGE! It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff. We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth? Candy bars? Aaaah! Runrunruuun! The aliens are chasing us! I think we ditched them. What the? Where are, where are we? It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship. Yeah. Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay. No! Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover? Earth? You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up. What?? Who cancelled us? Dude, we have to try! Mighty powerful network executives, Please don't cancel us. Please. Oh my God, this is great! Kenny! The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show. And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons. Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night. What the hell is that? Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve. Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something. What? Cartman, just stay out of it. Yup. I'm not seeing anything. A reindeer? How dare she talk to us like that?! TP her house? Oh. Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious. You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman? Oh.  Uuugh. Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside. So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it! We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man! What have we done? We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble. How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up! Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman! Noo! No.  Noo! Ah! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house? I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality test? Ah, Ah I, ah I thought... Why are they doing us one at a time? I can get a better deal? Noo! No.  Noo! Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm! I was... I was just going to get a drink of water. Oh. Okay. Thanks. Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now. What's this all about, Cartman? A boat ride? Well, okay. Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters. I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now. Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow. What the hell are you doing, Cartman?! Cartman! You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! They did? Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense. You con-fessed? You guys, we can't let him do this! Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house. Because it was- I still feel bad, Cartman Yeah. That makes it even worse. I know. We feel bad for other people. You can't kill all three of us, Cartman! Hold it!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Dreible. We have something we need to tell you. We have to confess that we were the ones that- Cartman?? That's not fair! But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience! This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair! Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now. Oh Jesus! You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention! Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing! What should we do? Ih ih ih-t's g-gay? Uuuh, n-no blood for oil. Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work! Shut up and study! What are you doing? That isn't gonna work, dumbass! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're suppsoed to be studying! Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard! Cartman? Cartman?? No, turdpants, it's Kyle! Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit! Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?! Cartman?  Cartman?? Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!! But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again! Oh, Jesus... God damnit! Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap? We didn't do our homework. He does? Cartman? Cartman saved the day? And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. Cool. No way. It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture. No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over! Stop it! Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman! She's not eating it, it's just comint out her backside! Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman! God damnit! Cartman, will you stop this gayness?! That's not what I meant! Can we go now, please?! Stop it, Cartman! ...What? No! Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson. Good. Aw, God-damnit! That does it. I'm out. Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing! I hate you. Come in.  COME IN!! So stop doing it! You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here! Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand hand doesn't need to breathe! I can see your lips moving! See?! I just saw your lips move! Come here!  You're not actually buying this crap, are you?! Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, ""Haha, I got you guys to believe me!"" ""You guys are stupid!"" YES, dude! Out! Oh Jesus. Oh no, no no, nonono. Stop. It. Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor? All right.  All right, I guess it's possible. Awww, shit! Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea. Really? Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am. I think we can piece this case together now. Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory. Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet. Then saw off the arms and legs. But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog. We're in business! Do you kow where your doll is? All right, let's see.  Damnit Kenny, that's not what she said! But the window isn't locked. Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brough a shovel to decapitate it. Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty! Yeah, but how? How... do you make semen come out? Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and mager...venate your weiner really fast. No-o! What?  What?? They've got the doll! What do we do now? Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people. We've got to do something. ...Grrrr!!! But they said we can't charge the front door. We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, assface! Wow! Ah... a a a meth lab? What is a meth lab, anyway? Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it. We're sorry. Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore. Better how, dude? We were happy playing Laundromat Owners. Uh wu we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison. Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was- No. Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble. Uh, it's okay. We know the owner. Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat. Certainly. What is Native American comedy, anyway? Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go. I said I wanna leave. What?? No, no, I mean, I- Native Americans. Dog parade? How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that? The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one.  That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand. What the hell are they doing?? You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away! Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for. Hey dudes. What? Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear. Hi Mom, Hi Dad! I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! Thanks. Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual. I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me. Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around? Stan? No! Ah! I got beat up at school... for being different. No! For not being a metrosexual. Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too? Gah! Just leave me alone! GRRRRR!! That does it! I know what I have to do! One ticket to New York, please. I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people. Mrrh.  Mr. Garrison? I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people! Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first! I thoght of it first! Did so! Did so! I thought of it two days ago! Cool. Clear! They aren't gay? Then what are they? AAAAAAAAAAAAH! You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy! No Mr. President!! Don't do it!  Help! Mom! What? Y-you want me to hang out with you? ...No, dude, it really isn't cool. You He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz. I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration. Christian rock?! That's a retarded idea, Cartman! Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band! You're on, fat boy! What a stupid asshole! Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars? Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound. Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life! Hold it.  Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops. Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew! Aaaargh! It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs! Really? All right, cool.  Let's donwload some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder. Judas Priest.  Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome! I don't know.  Let me go check. I don't know! Um, sir- We d-didn't think it was that big a deal. What's the matter with him? We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh... So, he's gonna get it, right? No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime! Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play! We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off! You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd! You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now! Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways! Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey! You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever! I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop. That's us!  ""Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies."" ""We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha."" He did it. Cartman got a platinum album. He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play. Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening. From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?! Oh. I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say ""Congratulations. You were right"" And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it. Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars. This is the worse day of my life. Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy! You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died! It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal. Dude, look! I don't know. Dude, is that your dad? I can't understand him. Why are they all out driving at the same time? Aah! There's another one! Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside. They're saying something about taking over the entire country. We can't fight them, Cartman. Country Kitchen Buffet? That's a retarded idea, Cartman! Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down? You guys! You guys! I have awesome news! No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!. It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants. Who said I'm inviting you? Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend. I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one. Because Butters isn't a total dick to me! Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!  KYLE You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. Sorry, my mind's made up. I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita. I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go. That isn't it, Cartman. That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater! I know you don't. Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday! Well? How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time? Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did. I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita. Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go? That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too. And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place. Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago. Yeah, screw him. Let's go.  Oh, finally! Oh. Thanks, dude. Oh wait. Cartman. Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us? I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in? All right, let's go. Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight. Aw dude, weak. Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing. Nah, I can't. We should help look for him. Yeah. And then we can try the football field. Yeah, it's pretty cool. Oh, awesome. What? What? I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all! It's too late, fatass.  They'll be here in less than a minute. Cartman! Oh, dude, what a little asshole! Dude, that new kid is such a douche! Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face! What are they doing? What happened? You're having dinenr with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that? Yeah. Did you make out with him, too? Wow! Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary? Oh no... B to the U to the T to the T to the O to the U to the T to the C to the I to the G to the A to the R to the E to the T to the T to the E! Butt out, cigarette! Dude, this is unbearable. Hey! What's the big deal? I like smoking, and it makes me cool! So don't believe what those evil tobacco companies tell you! Aw dude, this is really hard. Throw 'em away!  Dudes, here he comes. Guys, stop coughing. D'awww sick! Oh God... Yeah. This is really their fault. Who's Rob Reiner? You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke. Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now? Oh no... But... isn't that, kind of, lying? What?? So, tobacco helped to build America. That sound perfectly reasonable. But dude, you're making stuff up. Guys, I thnk we shold bail out of this right now! This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it, it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something. Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial. No, we really want nothing more to do with these people. What are you doing? Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. Who's going to kill you? Yeah dude, don't get us killed too. No dude, get away! Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself! Yeah dude. You were totally wrong. No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded. Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula! God-damnit! No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it. You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole! No. Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan? Why? Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework. God damnit!  Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. 'K.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you. No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live. Dude, not now! Jeez, he's worse than I thought. No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins. What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh? Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cure, huh?  Why don't you say hi to her?  Excuse me? Hey. Uh, this is Stan. Okay. Okay, come on you guys. Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there. What are you doing? Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball. Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life? Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time! Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?! God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home! Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy! Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back! Yeah. She is. Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable. Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play! No Ike! Shh! Ike's not my little brother anymore? Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay? You'd better!  Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? Iif he knew the situation, he might e- Guys.  Guys, I need your help. It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone. Please, you guys, you don't understand. My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying. I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then- What? Is that true? I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money. It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this. We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure. Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines. Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible. Four. How about fifty daura? Fifty-five daura. Okay. Sixty daura. Okay. Got it. Why not? You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid. All right! We're going to Canada! Hey, where the hell are you going?? I'm trying! No. Hey! We're in Canada! Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back? Who's that? Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is? So how do we get to Ottawa? Word! Who are you? That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves. French Canada? We don't have time for this. Hello? Okay, you can come with us. God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW! Can we just get going, please? There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now! Well come on! Do you think we can still make it in time? We need to see the new Prime Minister. No. No!! Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me. Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back. Really? Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was- Ike! Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything. But why are you making such strange laws?? You... bastards!  Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred? And, and takes away mounties' horses? And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?! What the hell?? Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back. Dude, come on. Stop it, Cartman! Goddamnit Cartman, stope throwin' those stupid popping things at me! Wow, cool. Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude. Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?? Kaii yo! Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bounaku , a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble. No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them. You don't know anything about Jews, fatass! I still say this is a bad idea. But don't tell anybody we have them. Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next. Goddamnit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers! No asshole! From now on you only get to have ONE power! So what is it?! That doesn't count, fatass! Who the hell is that?? Whoa. Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchakus Sokuromoto! Okay, okay, you can have your powers back. Goddamnit Cartman! What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?! Oh man! We are in serious trouble! I agree with Cartman! You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons! Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his brain! If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened. God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again. Ohh no. That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?? Butters needs medical attention right now!! We need some more fur.  I think that's good. We've gotta hurry, it's getting late! Quick, hide Butters! He said, not now, Craig! I swore to never fight again. Oh no. Butters! Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye, and we were taking him to the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters! Butters! Hey Butters! Dude, look! Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you? Yeah, we know. Butters! It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence! Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything. We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now! Screw you, fatass! I, I can't do it. ... I can't do it. I... Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these! Where?! Then it's NOT too late! We have to get past them! You have that power too? Oh dude, we are gonna get it now. Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons? Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman should be punished! They're Olympic games for handicapped people. Yeah, that'd be cool. Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys. ...You're an asshole, Cartman. What? Oh no. Cartman, no! Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics! Because! God damn you! No you're not!  I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics. It says right there ""a parent has to be with you to sign up,"" and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so HA! Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive. I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it! I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman! I came here to talk about you! I'm a Vulcan! The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing. No! I'm on the away team too! I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again! I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge. No it doesn't. No I'm not! Goddamnit Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again! Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything! He does not! Naw uh! I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole! People don't hate the Jews! ...You're a stupid asshole! One please. Yeah, I know, but I have to- ...Thanks. Haaaah! How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus? You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know. You were, you were right? You were right. Kill Jesus! Yesss! Arrrgh! Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over. Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it ...so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord. Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night. But how can the Jews make it better?? Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course. I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father. Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus. If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it. I saw The Passion. Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more. Nonono! Don't become an angry mob! The last time we did that we killed Jesus! Look out!! Dude, what's wrong with him? Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of THAT guy's movie? Sweet. I made mine go off the jump. Hey, who are those kids? ...What the hell just happened? Yeah. Dude, that is a sweet RC car. We're not interested, thanks. Yeah! Go Stan! All right Stan! Yeah! YOU got served! That's right! What the hell are you doing, fatass? Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O,  I'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top. Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago. Hey look! Hey. Do you live here? Dude, he must be loaded! What does he do? What's wrong with his face? Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up. Mr. Jefferson? Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house. Dude, what happened to your knee? Mr. Jefferson! Mr.! Goddamnit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up. Alright, this is gonna sting for a second. I know, I know. Be cool. So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters? And where is your mom? You must have a mom.  You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what? What? So you never met your mom? Yeah. Yeah, that counts. You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid. Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one. They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat? Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard. He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home. What?? Come on, Blanket. That poor kid. Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with? Jesus Christ, dude! Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him! All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude. I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on! Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay? Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us. You bastard! Come on! Hang on, Blanket! All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!  Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up! All right! Things just might work out! You've been on your fucking phone since we started! A break from what?! You haven't done anything! All you ever do is talk about your balls! If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us! Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it. Dude. What?! Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language! Aw, dude. This is really gay. Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in ""Giant Douche."" Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant Douche. It was MY idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in ""Giant Douche!"" It's way funnier! Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich? Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich? That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche. You hate Butters. You misled him, fatass! Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier.. A giant douche. Giant douche. A giant douche. All right, it's decided. Let's all write in ""Giant Douche."" Cartman? What the hell?? You won't get more votes than us, asshole! Be sure to vote for Giant Douche. Giant Douche is your man! Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich. There. Do you really want that asshole to win? What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?? Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy. You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now? Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part. Look... wait, what are you doing? No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich. ...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche. Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?! Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?! Puffy! Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal?  Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche. HA! You lose, fatass! That is fucking stupid, Cartman! Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish? Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie? You only need one copy, artard! Okay, fine, I will!  Huh, wait a minute! I don't even want ONE copy of Time Cop! Dude, I can't deal with Wall*Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night. Why, Mr. Farkle? Cartman, stop it! See? That sucks, dude! Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores? And what about all the- What the hell? Butters? Uh what the hell are you doing? But you run the Wall*Mart. You hate Wall*Mart too? No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall*Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility. It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall*Mart down. Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the? How... How did this happen?  Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here? Hey! Hey!  Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?! But nobody wants a Wall*Mart here! Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall*Mart once and for all! No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall*Mart. Yeah huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, ""Haha, I was working for Wall*Mart all along"" or something. All right, fine. Come on, fatass! I heard that! You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall*Mart! He is working for the Wall*Mart to stup us from succeeding! God-damnit! It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires! Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall*Mart in our town. We want to talk to who's in charge. So how do we stop it? The heart of Wall*Mart? All right. Come on you guys, we have to get back home. All right, this is it! If Wall*Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall*Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it. I knew you were! Yes I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this! Yes I did!! Yes I did!! Yes I did!! Yes I did!! -slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I-  -and I told you that- We don't have time for this! Kenny, keep him away from us! We've gotta find the television department. I think I see the television department in the back! Who are you? Where's the heart? The question is, ""Where is the heart?"" The Wall*Mart is exploding! Everybody out now! All Wall*Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back. Duh. Okay, hang on a second I- All right, all right!  Dude, what is the matter with you? Trent Boyett?? The kid from preschool?? Oh no! NO! Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall. Yeah. Look, m-maybe he's forgiven us. I mean, we were only in preschool Totally, dude, let's play Fireman. Shut up, fatass! Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool! Do you know how to start a fire? We're firemen! Code 7! Bring in the firemen! We're heroes!  We saved the school. My mon is gonna break my legs! Not us. We're good kids. Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us! We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident! Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it. That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years! Dude, we shouldn't be here! We need you to protect us... from a bully. Well...  Well, what do you want? Wait! We'll do it. Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes? What else has big round squishy globes? No, the nipples are more in the middle, see? How do you know?! Oh wait! We forgot the necklace. God I hope this works. Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett? Naw. Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up! Oh, Jesus. You told him that?! We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible! From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders. So you're gonna help us? The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids. Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you! Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad! Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit. What?? Geez, and all that from a stupid video show. Gah, I just don't get it. Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, he'll let us stay on the air! How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry. Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on. Maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die. Eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, Pete Thelman , pees sitting down like a girl. We've also got confirmation that Sally Turner stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle. We're making the news more appealing to students. We beat Close-up Animals! Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig. What if we do a show where we go to- Uh, no. Thee... uhhh. What if the-? Wait! You know what we should do? We should all take a bunch of cough medicine! That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads. How do we know which one to use? It's not? Oh, okay. All right, now everybody take a tablet and a pencil.  and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise. Stan?  Dude, Stan, you all right? Me too. I could watch this for days. Ah! Butters, get away from me! I wrote down... all the lyrics to the Happy Days theme song. Jesus, you may be right. So where are students getting all this cough medicine??  This surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist!  Sexy Action School News reported the pharmacist to the South Park police, and he was immediately arrested! Twenty-two people?? All right! What's going on? Do it! Do it! Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay Cartman! Fly fly fly! Awww, go on and do it already! Cartman, what did you do?! Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it! Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why?! You don't have any powers! He can't do crap! Ha! You see?! What?! This is fuckin' ridiculous! What the hell is wrong with these people?! Hey! What about this guy?! Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?! Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis.  I'm pretty sure he's your man. No. Why won't anybody listen to me?! I AM taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman. Be sure to take me to the same hospital! All right, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day we rerme- aw screw it! I see... a man... with a baseball cap. He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m. No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard. What the hell? My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas. Well, because, we don't really ...believe in Jesus. No. I'm Jewish. Huh? Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?! No.  No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me! With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews! Yes, yes!! Now the Jews will take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!! Oh, stop it, Cartman! Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story! This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again! Dude, why do you care?! Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved! All right, fine! HAHAHAA!! Now I shall rule the-  Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire! Whoa. Oh, I don't like this! I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil! Oh God, what have I done??  I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist. Thanks, everybody. I I'm sorry I got a little crazy there. How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years. I beat out YOUR fat ass, Cartman! Yeah? Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day. Oo whataya mean? I know. I deserve it. You're right.  Jesus, that was fun... But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do. Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation? But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come? Yeah. That's right. Totally! I totally understand! Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one. Well, do you also do other surgeries like that? No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black. I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man. Yeah! Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery. Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I?? But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves. Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside. Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it? But Jews can't play basketball! I'm never speaking to either of you ever again! Yeah, but it was totally worth it. Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again! All right, Dad! Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play. Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now? All right!  Dad, I can play! I'm a hundred percent ready, coach! All right!  Ow. Hm. I got it! I got the ball. Hey, let's ask them. Wha- whataya mean? Ugh! Those dirty liars! Yeah, we're pissed off. Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You said it! Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em. Yeah, it's called a town. You're doing what? We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us. Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us. How come we never get opportunities like that? We're not talented? Probably. Why? Can I talk to you?! What the hell are you doing?! Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years! Yes he does! Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass! Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you. Welcome to the team, Token. We knew you could do it! Twenty dollars. Mister, you can't do this to us! All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?! Sir, we would love to sign your wife. Jesus, we made it just in time! Oh crap! Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well- Aw, just forget it! Goddamnit! Goddamnit! Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show? Hey, is your show as good as America Idol? Let's do it Wing! Oh my God, dude! What? Get out! Woohoo! Yeah! What do you mean? We thought she was with you. Wing? Wing? They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again! Damn, CAA is pretty impressive. You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?! You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW! Dude, maybe we should give up! Cartman! Wing?? Stupid talent agents! All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny? Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you! They killed Kenny! She had a contract with us first! We own her! Her life belongs to us! Yeah. Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling. Me too. Token? That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it? Wuh what'd I do? Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in ""Heaven versus Hell."" Kenny had a will? That's... really touching. Oh my God! Kenny! You're alive! He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP! He did not! Did not! Cartman! Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF! That dirty no-good sonofabitch! How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate? Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in! Yeah, come on! We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain! You say tomato, but I say Kenny! Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... mmaybe we shhhould just let Kenny go in peace. Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons. Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone. Aw God, I'm so borrred. Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season! No more boring baseball until next year! Nobody said anything about a post-season. I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing. You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport. You hate this game too? No, we're gonna get creamed! Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base. Crud! We're so proud of you kids! What?? Dude, what are we gonna do?? We can't win this game. I know who. There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team. You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title! Aw crap! Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat. Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long. Get up! You have to fight! God, this is gonna be sooo yummy. She's here! I want some! Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good. All right, let's eat Colonel! The skin's the best part... You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time! Hello?? I've been saying this for years! Yes, but he thrives on that. That sounds great! Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow? Thanks. We're ignoring him. Beause he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath! There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself! It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him. He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle. We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have. Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy. I don't know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people? Huh wuh, what's the matter? Cool. Mom's special stew. She makes it every Monday and I love it. Yeah, dude, it's great! Mom? How am I related to him again? Yeah, but like... first cousin or distant cousin? So we have the same blood? What?? How the hell am I supposed to do that?? What about Cartman, huh? He rips on me for being Jewish! He's gonna tear this kid apart! Oh my God. Well what do you mean?  What room is he sleeping in? I don't know, dude. I don't think so. Okay. Cartman, I need to talk to you. Cartman, I'm gonna make you a deal. That kid over there is my cousin from the East Coast. He's having a really hard time right now, so I'm going to offer you forty dollars to not rip on him. But you can't make fun of him AT ALL. No smartass comments, nothin'. And you especially can't say anythng about Jews! Cartman, no Jew jokes! All you have to do is keep your mouth shut, and you've got forty bucks! Can you do it? Alright. Kyle, this is Cartman, my sort of... friend- ish. What? CARTMAN! You need to learn to play some sports, Kyle. So we're gonna start with a tough one called, ""Catch the Ball."" I throw the football to you; you throw it back to me. It's fine! Ih it's a football, dude. You just- put your arms out and catch it.  Alright, here we go. Now throw it back to me. ...So dig it out. ...Well, then we'll dry them off! Oh my God. Yeah! They WERE, Cartman! You did, too! You are so full of crap! You blew the deal, Cartman! Nuh-uh, I knew you were gonna make fun of my lame cousin, so I paid you the forty bucks NOT to rip on him! You ripped on him, deal's off! Oh no. Look, ih it's not because anything's wrong with you. Kyle, I-eh I'm sorry What? Uh-uh-uh oh, dude. Uh I can't take it anymore, Stan. My cousin's been here for two weeks and he's driving me insane. Ispent five years in this town making a good name for Jews and this... this... stereotype shows up and wrecks it all! You know what my biggest fear is? That I'll become him. That somehow his mannerisms will start rubbing off on me, and I'll become a stereotype. I mean, I'm a Jew and he's making me hate Jews. Ya see? Ugh. Look, Kyle. Sledding is something all kids out here do. You've gotta learn. Remember: Just hold on. No matter how long the sledding run lasts, hold on. Hang on! How far do you thnk it is to Connecticut? Think he'll be alright. ...Hm, that was pretty gay. You know, it's just possible he went back to Conencticut. Well, ah I mean, maybe he got so worried about his mom that found a way to get back and see her. I'm just throwin' it out there as a possibility. AAA! A, a bus. R-really? Oh no- don't worry about it, dude. Kyle, we told you: Kids in Colorado all play hide and seek at the airport. Ungh, this is taking too long. The flight to Connecticut is about to leave. Ey! Can we speed things up here?? Dude, we're the only ones here! How long does it take five people through security?! No! This is ridiculous! Come on! Okay, Cartman, you're it. Start counting. Here, Kyle. You go hide in here. JUST GET IN THE BOX! I hope he doesn't suffocate. I dunno, Mom. It's like he vanished into thin air. I already checked the playground, Ma. I told you, he isn't really- GAAAH! No. I tried getting my cousin lost in the woods, but a stupid bear brought him home. I just have to face facts that I'm gointuh live with my crappy cousin forever. ...What? Do you promise??  I mean, oh. Thah-uh that's too bad, dude. What, what changed for you? Okay. See ya, cousin. Hope to see ya soon.  Not too soon, I hope. Dudedudedude! You you have five miliion dollars?? Wait. Kyle, this may sound crazy, but I think you should stay! Yeah. You see, I've learned something today.  Sometimes people have trouble fitting in at, at school and,...  and um... Let's see, what did I learn about? What did I learn about today? Nonono, it was good! What were you going to say?"
